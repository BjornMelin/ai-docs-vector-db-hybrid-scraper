## ML Model Enhancement Proposal

**Model Type**: [e.g., Load Prediction, Query Optimization, Connection Pool Scaling]
**Current Model**: [e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network]
**Proposed Enhancement**: [e.g., Transformer-based predictor, Ensemble method, Feature engineering]
**Expected Improvement**: [e.g., 15% prediction accuracy, 30% faster inference]

## Current Model Performance

### Baseline Metrics
```bash
# Current model evaluation
uv run python scripts/evaluate_ml_models.py --model load_predictor
# Results:
# Accuracy: 78.5%
# Precision: 82.1%
# Recall: 74.3%
# F1-Score: 78.0%
# MAE: 12.4ms
# RMSE: 18.7ms
# Inference time: 2.3ms
```

### Performance Analysis
**Strengths of Current Model**
- Fast inference time suitable for real-time predictions

- Low memory footprint and computational requirements

**Identified Weaknesses**
- Poor performance on edge cases (sudden traffic spikes)
- Limited feature engineering for temporal patterns
- Accuracy degrades with seasonal variations
- Overconfidence in predictions during anomalous periods

**Production Metrics**
```bash
# Real-world performance data
# Prediction accuracy: 78.5% over last 30 days
# False positive rate: 12.3% (over-provisioning)
# False negative rate: 8.9% (under-provisioning)
# Average prediction latency: 2.1ms
# Model drift detected: 3 times in last month
```

## Proposed Enhancement

### Technical Approach

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class EnhancedLoadPredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_features=64, hidden_size=128, num_layers=3):
        super().__init__()
        self.feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()
        self.temporal_encoder = LSTMEncoder(hidden_size, num_layers)
        self.attention_layer = MultiHeadAttention(hidden_size)
        self.predictor = MLPPredictor(hidden_size, output_size=1)
        
    def forward(self, x, temporal_features):
        # Enhanced prediction logic with attention mechanism
        features = self.feature_extractor(x)
        temporal_encoding = self.temporal_encoder(temporal_features)
        attended_features = self.attention_layer(features, temporal_encoding)
        prediction = self.predictor(attended_features)

    def process_features(self, raw_data):
        # Multi-modal feature processing
        temporal_features = self.temporal_encoder.encode(raw_data.timestamp)
        system_features = self.system_metrics_scaler.transform(raw_data.system_metrics)
        anomaly_scores = self.anomaly_detector.score_samples(raw_data.metrics)
        
        return {
            'temporal': temporal_features,
            'system': system_features,
            'anomaly_scores': anomaly_scores,

**Data Quality and Preprocessing**
```python

        self.outlier_detector = LocalOutlierFactor()
        self.missing_data_imputer = KNNImputer()
        self.feature_selector = SelectKBest()
        
    def prepare_training_data(self, raw_data):
        # Comprehensive data preparation
        cleaned_data = self.remove_outliers(raw_data)
        imputed_data = self.missing_data_imputer.fit_transform(cleaned_data)
        selected_features = self.feature_selector.fit_transform(imputed_data)
        return self.create_training_splits(selected_features)
```

**Training Configuration**

### Model Training and Optimization

    learning_rate = trial.suggest_loguniform('lr', 1e-5, 1e-2)
    hidden_size = trial.suggest_categorical('hidden_size', [64, 128, 256])
    num_layers = trial.suggest_int('num_layers', 2, 5)
    
    # Train model with suggested parameters
    model = EnhancedLoadPredictor(hidden_size=hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers)
    performance = train_and_evaluate(model, learning_rate)
    
    return performance.validation_accuracy
