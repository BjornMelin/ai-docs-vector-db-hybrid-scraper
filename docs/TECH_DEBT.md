| 2025-10-06 | CI workflows           | Evaluation harness budgets not yet wired into GitHub Actions; manual invocation required. | Medium confidence in regressions escaping until gating automated. | Medium | Add deterministic CI job executing rag_golden_eval with budgets, optional semantic lane, and publish artefacts. | High     | Platform Reliability |       | Gating deferred pending workflow refactor; tracked for upcoming release. |
| 2024-06-05 | src/api/app_factory.py | Removed unused search/cache service registrations from the app factory.                   | None; deletes dead abstraction layer.                             | Low    | Keep service factory focused on active embedding/vector services.                                               | Retired  | Core Platform        |       | Decision: library-first simplification keeps only supported services.    |
| 2025-03-17 | Dev environment setup  | Dev pytest fixtures require dev extras (`httpx`, `pytest-asyncio`, `asgi-lifespan`).       | Tests raise ModuleNotFoundError until extras installed.           | Low    | Document `uv pip install -e .[dev]` in onboarding; consider preflight check. | Medium | Developer Experience |       | Deferred to docs follow-up; noted during FastAPI registry refactor. |
