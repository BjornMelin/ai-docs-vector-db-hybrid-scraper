Quick solutions for the most common issues you might encounter. Most problems have simple fixes that don't require technical expertise.

## üö® Quick Fixes

### System Not Responding

**Try these first**:

1. **Check if services are running**: Look for any error messages in your terminal
2. **Restart the system**: Stop and restart the MCP server
3. **Verify network connection**: Ensure you have internet access
4. **Check system resources**: Close other heavy applications if needed

### Can't Connect to Server

**Simple checks**:

1. **Verify the server is running**: Look for startup messages
2. **Check port availability**: Default port is usually 6333 for Qdrant
3. **Try restarting services**: Use `./scripts/start-services.sh`
4. **Verify configuration**: Check that your `.env` file has correct settings

## üîç Search Problems

### No Search Results

**Symptoms**:

- Search returns empty results
- "No matches found" messages
- Search seems to run but finds nothing

**Most common causes and fixes**:

#### **1. Documents not indexed yet**

```bash
# Check if you have any collections
mcp list-collections

# If empty, add some documents first
mcp add-documents --path "/path/to/documents"
```

#### **2. Query too specific**

- **Try broader terms**: "database" instead of "PostgreSQL 15.2 configuration"
- **Use simpler language**: "setup guide" instead of "installation and configuration procedures"
- **Break up complex queries**: Search for one concept at a time

#### **3. Wrong terminology**

- **Try alternative words**: "config" vs "configuration", "docs" vs "documentation"
- **Use questions instead**: "How do I configure the database?" vs "database configuration"

#### **4. Collection issues**

```bash
# Check specific collection
mcp search --query "your terms" --collection "collection-name"

# Try searching all collections
mcp search --query "your terms" --collections "all"
```

### Poor Quality Results

**Symptoms**:

- Results don't match what you're looking for
- Irrelevant content in top results
- Missing obvious matches

**Solutions**:

#### **1. Improve your query**

- **Add context**: "Python web scraping tutorial" vs just "scraping"
- **Be more specific**: "fix SSL certificate error" vs "fix error"
- **Use natural language**: "Why is my search slow?" vs "search performance"

#### **2. Try different search approaches**

- **Question format**: "What is the best way to..."
- **Problem-solution format**: "When X happens, how do I fix Y?"
- **Comparison format**: "Difference between A and B"

#### **3. Check your expectations**

- Are you searching the right collection?
- Is the information actually in the system?
- Try searching for something you know exists first

### Search Taking Too Long

**Symptoms**:

- Searches hang or timeout
- Very slow response times
- System becomes unresponsive

**Quick fixes**:

#### **1. Simplify your query**

- Use fewer words
- Search for one concept at a time
- Avoid very broad terms like "everything about..."

#### **2. Reduce result count**

```bash
# Limit results to speed up search
mcp search --query "your terms" --limit 5
```

#### **3. Check system resources**

- Close other applications using memory
- Restart the system if it's been running for a long time
- Try searching during off-peak hours

## üåê Web Scraping Problems

### Scraping Returns Empty Content

**Symptoms**:

- Blank or minimal text returned
- Only headers/navigation extracted
- Content seems incomplete

**Solutions**:

#### **1. Verify the website works**

- Open the URL in your browser manually
- Check if the content is actually there
- Ensure the site doesn't require login

#### **2. Try different URLs**

- Use direct links to content pages
- Avoid homepage URLs when possible
- Try specific article or page URLs

#### **3. Allow more time**

- Some sites need extra time to load content
- Dynamic sites may take 10-30 seconds
- The system automatically retries with different methods

#### **4. Check for common issues**

```bash
# Test with a simple site first
mcp scrape --url "https://example.com"

# If that works, try your target site
mcp scrape --url "https://your-target-site.com"
```

### Scraping Gets Blocked

**Symptoms**:

- "Access denied" errors
- Captcha challenges
- Rate limiting messages
- Bot detection warnings

**Respectful solutions**:

#### **1. Slow down your requests**

- Wait longer between scraping attempts
- Don't scrape the same site repeatedly
- Space out requests by several minutes

#### **2. Check site policies**

- Look for robots.txt file (add /robots.txt to the domain)
- Respect any crawling restrictions
- Consider if the content is meant to be scraped

#### **3. Try different approaches**

- Use specific page URLs instead of general crawling
- Focus on publicly available content
- Consider if there's an official API available

#### **4. Alternative strategies**

- Look for RSS feeds or sitemaps
- Check if content is available through official channels
- Consider reaching out to the site owner

### Scraping Is Too Slow

**Symptoms**:

- Very long wait times
- Frequent timeouts
- Sites seem to hang

**Optimizations**:

#### **1. Target better sites**

- Simple, static sites work faster
- Well-structured sites give better results
- Avoid heavily dynamic or complex sites

#### **2. Be more specific**

- Use direct URLs to the content you need
- Avoid scraping entire sites when you need specific pages
- Target content-rich pages rather than navigation pages

#### **3. Understand tier escalation**

- Simple sites use fast methods (seconds)
- Complex sites automatically use slower, more thorough methods (minutes)
- This is normal and ensures you get the content

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Issues

### API Keys Not Working

**Symptoms**:

- Authentication errors
- "Invalid API key" messages
- Services not responding

**Solutions**:

#### **1. Check your .env file**

- Ensure API keys are correct and complete
- No extra spaces or quotes around the keys
- Keys should start with the correct prefix (sk- for OpenAI)

#### **2. Verify key validity**

- Test keys directly with the provider's website
- Check if keys have necessary permissions
- Ensure keys haven't expired

#### **3. Restart after changes**

- Always restart the server after changing .env
- Changes to configuration require a restart to take effect

### Services Won't Start

**Symptoms**:

- Error messages during startup
- Services fail to connect
- Port conflicts

**Common fixes**:

#### **1. Check prerequisites**

- Docker is running (for Qdrant)
- Python version is 3.13+
- All dependencies installed with `uv sync`

#### **2. Check for conflicts**

- Other services using the same ports
- Previous instances still running
- Firewall blocking connections

#### **3. Clean restart**

```bash
# Stop everything
docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Restart services
./scripts/start-services.sh
```

## üîß Performance Issues

### System Running Slowly

**General performance tips**:

#### **1. Resource management**

- Close unnecessary applications
- Ensure adequate RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Check available disk space

#### **2. Optimize usage patterns**

- Use specific searches rather than broad exploration
- Limit result counts when you don't need many results
- Batch similar operations together

#### **3. Regular maintenance**

- Restart services periodically
- Clear temporary files if disk space is low
- Update to the latest version when available

### Memory Issues

**Symptoms**:

- System becomes unresponsive
- Out of memory errors
- Very slow performance

**Solutions**:

#### **1. Reduce memory usage**

- Process smaller batches of documents
- Use more specific search queries
- Close other memory-intensive applications

#### **2. Adjust processing**

- Use smaller chunk sizes for document processing
- Process documents in smaller batches
- Allow more time for garbage collection

## üÜò When to Get Help

### Self-Diagnosis Steps

Before asking for help, try these:

1. **Test with simple examples**
   - Try a basic search you know should work
   - Test scraping with a simple site like example.com
