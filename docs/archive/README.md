# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but is preserved for reference.

## Directory Structure

### `sprint-2025-05/`
Contains documentation from the Critical Architecture Cleanup & Unification sprint (Issues #17-28, PR #32):
- Sprint summaries and architectural decisions
- API/SDK integration refactor documentation
- Historical implementation details

### `mcp-legacy/`
Contains documentation for deprecated MCP server implementations:
- Original MCP server guides (pre-unified architecture)
- Legacy architecture patterns
- Enhancement plans that have been implemented

## Important Notes

- These documents reflect historical states of the project
- For current documentation, see the parent directories
- Many patterns described here are now deprecated in favor of the unified architecture
- Use these documents for historical context only

## Why Archive?

Preserving historical documentation helps:
- Understand architectural evolution
- Track decision-making processes
- Maintain context for future refactoring
- Provide reference for migration paths
