# Compliance and Privacy Protection Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive compliance and privacy protection strategy for the
AI documentation system. The strategy focuses on practical implementation of privacy principles,
regulatory alignment, and data protection measures specifically designed for AI systems handling
user queries and documentation content.

**Target Compliance**: GDPR-aligned privacy practices, SOC 2 readiness, ISO 27001 preparation
**Implementation Approach**: Privacy by design with minimal complexity
**Budget Impact**: <$500/month for comprehensive privacy protection  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for full implementation

---

## Privacy Protection Framework

### 🔒 Core Privacy Principles

#### 1. Data Minimization Principle

**Implementation**: Collect only data necessary for service functionality

```python
# Data Collection Policy (Enforced in Code)
class DataCollectionPolicy:
    ALLOWED_DATA = {
        "user_queries": "Required for search functionality",
        "anonymized_usage": "Required for system optimization",
        "security_logs": "Required for threat detection",
        "session_context": "Required for conversation continuity"
    }

    PROHIBITED_DATA = {
        "personal_identifiers": "No collection of PII",
        "location_data": "No geographic tracking",
        "device_fingerprinting": "No detailed device profiling",
        "cross_site_tracking": "No tracking pixels or cookies"
    }
```

#### 2. Purpose Limitation Principle

**Implementation**: Use data only for stated purposes

```yaml
# Data Usage Matrix
user_queries:
  purpose: "Provide AI-powered search and documentation assistance"
  retention: "30 days maximum"
  sharing: "No third-party sharing except anonymized analytics"

system_logs:
  purpose: "Security monitoring and system optimization"
  retention: "90 days for security logs, 7 days for debug logs"
  sharing: "No sharing outside security team"
```

#### 3. Transparency Principle

**Implementation**: Clear communication about data practices

## Regulatory Compliance Strategy

### 🌍 GDPR-Aligned Privacy Implementation

#### Data Subject Rights Implementation

```python
class PrivacyRightsHandler:
    """Implementation of data subject rights for GDPR alignment."""

    async def handle_access_request(self, user_id: str) -> dict:
        """Provide user with their stored data (Article 15)."""
        return {
            "query_history": await self.get_user_queries(user_id),
            "usage_analytics": await self.get_anonymized_usage(user_id),
            "data_processing_purpose": "AI-powered documentation search",
            "retention_period": "30 days for queries, 90 days for logs"
        }

    async def handle_deletion_request(self, user_id: str) -> bool:
        """Delete user data (Article 17 - Right to be forgotten)."""
        await self.delete_user_queries(user_id)
        await self.anonymize_user_logs(user_id)
        return True

    async def handle_portability_request(self, user_id: str) -> dict:
        """Export user data in structured format (Article 20)."""
        return {
            "format": "JSON",
            "data": await self.export_user_data(user_id),
            "export_date": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
```

#### Legal Basis for Processing

```yaml
processing_activities:
  search_queries:
    legal_basis: "Legitimate Interest (Article 6.1.f)"
    justification: "Providing AI-powered search functionality"
    balancing_test: "User benefit > minimal privacy impact"

  security_monitoring:
    legal_basis: "Legitimate Interest (Article 6.1.f)"
    justification: "Protecting system and user data from security threats"
    balancing_test: "Security protection > minimal monitoring impact"

  system_optimization:
    legal_basis: "Consent (Article 6.1.a)"
    justification: "Improving service quality with user consent"
    implementation: "Opt-in analytics with clear consent mechanism"
```

### 🏛️ SOC 2 Readiness Framework

#### Security Controls Implementation

```python
class SOC2ComplianceControls:
    """Implementation of SOC 2 Type II security controls."""

    # CC6.1 - Logical and Physical Access Controls
    async def implement_access_controls(self):
        return {
            "authentication": "API key-based with rotation",
            "authorization": "Role-based access control (RBAC)",
            "network_security": "VPC isolation and firewall rules",
            "data_encryption": "AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit"
        }

    # CC7.1 - System Operations
    async def implement_monitoring_controls(self):
        return {
            "logging": "Comprehensive security event logging",
            "monitoring": "Real-time threat detection and alerting",
            "backup": "Automated daily backups with encryption",
            "incident_response": "Documented procedures and escalation"
        }
```

## PII Protection Implementation

### 🛡️ "Detect and Redact" Protocol

#### Microsoft Presidio Integration

```python
class PIIProtectionService:
    """Comprehensive PII detection and protection service."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.analyzer = AnalyzerEngine()
        self.anonymizer = AnonymizerEngine()

    async def protect_user_input(self, text: str) -> tuple[str, list]:
        """Scan and redact PII from user inputs before processing."""

        # 1. Detect PII entities
        results = self.analyzer.analyze(
            text=text,
            language='en',
            entities=["PERSON", "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "PHONE_NUMBER",
                     "CREDIT_CARD", "SSN", "US_PASSPORT", "IP_ADDRESS"]
        )

        # 2. Apply redaction
        anonymized_result = self.anonymizer.anonymize(
            text=text,
            analyzer_results=results,
            operators={"DEFAULT": OperatorConfig("replace", {"new_value": "[REDACTED]"})}
        )

        # 3. Log PII detection events (without actual PII)
        if results:
            await self.log_pii_detection_event(len(results), [r.entity_type for r in results])

        return anonymized_result.text, results

    async def validate_llm_output(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Scan LLM output for potential PII leakage."""
        results = self.analyzer.analyze(text=text, language='en')

        if results:
            # Log potential data leakage
            await self.log_potential_data_leakage(results)

            # Apply output sanitization
            return self.anonymizer.anonymize(text=text, analyzer_results=results).text

        return text
```

#### PII Detection Configuration

```yaml
# Presidio Configuration
analyzer_config:
  score_threshold: 0.6 # Balance between accuracy and false positives
  supported_languages: ["en"]
  custom_recognizers:
    - api_key_patterns
    - internal_employee_ids
    - proprietary_data_formats

anonymizer_config:
  default_operator: "replace"
  replacement_value: "[REDACTED]"
  preserve_length: false # Don't preserve original length for security

pii_categories:
  high_risk: ["SSN", "CREDIT_CARD", "US_PASSPORT", "PHONE_NUMBER"]
  medium_risk: ["EMAIL_ADDRESS", "PERSON", "LOCATION"]
  low_risk: ["DATE_TIME", "IP_ADDRESS", "URL"]
```

## Data Lifecycle Management

### 📊 Data Retention Policy

#### Automated Data Lifecycle

```python
class DataLifecycleManager:
    """Automated data lifecycle management with compliance controls."""

    RETENTION_PERIODS = {
        "user_queries": timedelta(days=30),
        "security_logs": timedelta(days=90),
        "debug_logs": timedelta(days=7),
        "system_metrics": timedelta(days=365),
        "anonymized_analytics": timedelta(days=1095)  # 3 years
    }

    async def enforce_data_retention(self):
        """Daily job to enforce data retention policies."""
        current_time = datetime.utcnow()

        for data_type, retention_period in self.RETENTION_PERIODS.items():
            cutoff_date = current_time - retention_period
            await self.purge_data_before_date(data_type, cutoff_date)

    async def anonymize_aged_data(self, data_type: str, anonymize_after: timedelta):
        """Convert personal data to anonymized analytics."""
        cutoff_date = datetime.utcnow() - anonymize_after
        await self.convert_to_anonymous_analytics(data_type, cutoff_date)
```
