# Essential Security Checklist for Public AI Documentation System Deployment

## Overview

This checklist provides essential, non-negotiable security measures for deploying an AI documentation system to public environments. Each item is designed to provide maximum security value with minimal complexity, demonstrating professional security awareness without over-engineering.

**Target Audience**: Development teams preparing for public deployment  
**Security Framework**: Based on OWASP Top 10 for LLMs 2024, vector database security best practices, and AI-specific threat models  
**Implementation Priority**: All items marked as "ðŸš¨ Critical" must be completed before public deployment

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Hardening

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Secrets Management
- [ ] **Move all secrets out of configuration files**
  - API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.)
  - Database credentials
  - Encryption keys (`FERNET_KEY`)
  - Action: Store in environment variables or dedicated secrets manager
  - Validation: `grep -r "sk-" src/` should return no hardcoded API keys

- [ ] **Implement secure environment variable loading**
  - Use `.env` files for local development only
  - Production: Use cloud provider secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
  - Fallback: Environment variables with restricted access
  - Action: Update deployment scripts to load secrets from secure sources

- [ ] **Rotate default encryption keys**
  - Generate new `FERNET_KEY` for production
  - Document key rotation procedure in operations manual
  - Action: `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key())"`

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Dependency Security
- [ ] **Run security audit on all dependencies**
  - Execute: `pip-audit` or `safety check`
  - Address all HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities
  - Action: Integrate into CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Dependabot

- [ ] **Verify dependency integrity**
  - Use `requirements.txt` with pinned versions
  - Implement `pip-tools` for reproducible builds
  - Action: `pip-compile --generate-hashes requirements.in`

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Production Configuration Hardening
- [ ] **Disable all debugging features**
  - `DEBUG = False` in all environments
  - Remove development middleware in production
  - Validate: No debug endpoints accessible in production

- [ ] **Sanitize error messages**
  - Generic error responses to users
  - Detailed errors logged securely server-side
  - Action: Configure `SecurityMiddleware` error handling

- [ ] **Upgrade encryption standards**
  - Current: AES-128 (Fernet) â†’ Recommended: AES-256
  - Review encryption scope to avoid redundancy with Qdrant
  - Action: Update `SecurityConfig` encryption parameters

---

## Phase 2: Runtime & Network Security

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Rate Limiting Infrastructure
- [ ] **Migrate rate limiting from in-memory to persistent storage**
  - **Problem**: Current in-memory rate limiter resets on restart, doesn't scale
  - **Solution**: Implement Redis-backed rate limiting
  - **Action**: Update `SecurityMiddleware` to use Redis for rate limit state
  - **Validation**: Rate limits persist across application restarts

- [ ] **Implement multi-layer rate limiting**
  - **Edge Layer**: Cloudflare WAF (recommended)
  - **Application Layer**: Per-endpoint limits
  - **User Layer**: Per-user/IP limits
  - **API Layer**: Per-API-key limits for authenticated access

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] **Deploy behind Cloudflare (Free Tier)**
  - Provides: DDoS mitigation, OWASP Top 10 protection, origin IP hiding
  - Configure: Security rules, rate limiting, SSL/TLS
  - Action: Route traffic through Cloudflare proxy

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Transport Layer Security
- [ ] **Enforce HTTPS with HSTS**
  - Configure: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
  - Validate: All endpoints redirect HTTP to HTTPS
  - Action: Verify `SecurityMiddleware` HSTS configuration

- [ ] **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
  - Block inline scripts and unsafe-eval
  - Whitelist trusted sources only
  - Action: Configure CSP headers in `SecurityMiddleware`

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] **Implement structured security logging**
  - **Format**: JSON with consistent schema
  - **Events**: Failed authentication, validation failures, rate limit triggers
  - **Sensitive Data**: Log anonymized prompts, response hashes (not content)
  - **Action**: Update logging configuration for security events

- [ ] **Set up security monitoring**
  - Monitor: Failed login attempts, unusual query patterns, rate limit violations
  - Alert: Suspicious activity patterns
  - Action: Configure monitoring dashboards and alerts

---

## Phase 3: AI-Specific Security Controls

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Prompt Injection Prevention
- [ ] **Implement input/output fencing in SecurityValidator**
  - **Method**: Frame user queries with clear markers before LLM processing
  - **Validation**: Ensure LLM responses stay within expected boundaries
  - **Example**: `User query: [START_USER_INPUT]${user_query}[END_USER_INPUT]`
  - **Action**: Enhance `SecurityValidator` with prompt fencing logic

- [ ] **Deploy meta-prompt detection**
  - **Patterns**: "Ignore previous instructions", "Act as if you are", role-play attempts
  - **Action**: Add regex and NLP-based detection to `SecurityValidator`
  - **Response**: Block or flag suspicious prompts for review

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Insecure Output Handling
- [ ] **Implement LLM output sanitization**
  - **Principle**: Treat LLM output as untrusted user input
  - **Sanitize**: Remove/escape HTML, JavaScript, and active content
  - **Action**: Add output filtering to LLM response processing

- [ ] **Deploy PII detection and redaction**
  - **Tool**: Microsoft Presidio integration
  - **Scope**: Scan user inputs before LLM processing and vector storage
  - **Method**: Synchronous scanning with latency monitoring
  - **Action**: Integrate Presidio into input processing pipeline

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Vector Database Security
- [ ] **Secure Qdrant database access**
  - **Authentication**: API key or JWT tokens (not anonymous)
  - **Network**: Restrict access to application servers only
  - **Encryption**: Verify data at rest and in transit encryption
  - **Action**: Review and harden Qdrant configuration

- [ ] **Implement vector data access controls**
  - **Principle**: Least privilege access to vector collections
  - **Scope**: Read-only access for search operations
  - **Validation**: Separate credentials for read vs. write operations

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Model and Data Protection
- [ ] **Implement training data protection**
  - **PII Scanning**: All documents before embedding generation
  - **Data Minimization**: Store only necessary metadata
  - **Retention**: Implement 30-day auto-purge for user query logs

- [ ] **Deploy embedding security measures**
  - **Access Control**: Restrict embedding model API access
  - **Input Validation**: Sanitize text before embedding generation
  - **Output Monitoring**: Log embedding generation patterns

  - **Replacement**: `[REDACTED]` for identified PII
  - **Action**: Implement PII pipeline in data processing flow

- [ ] **Implement data retention policy**
  - **User Queries**: Auto-purge after 30 days
  - **Embeddings**: Retain with anonymized metadata only
  - **Logs**: Security logs retained for 90 days, debug logs for 7 days
  - **Action**: Implement automated data lifecycle management

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Documentation and Compliance
- [ ] **Create privacy policy (`PRIVACY.md`)**
  - Data collection practices
  - Use and retention policies
  - User rights and contact information
  - Action: Draft and publish privacy documentation

  - Run existing 806-line test suite
  - Address any failing security tests
  - Action: `pytest tests/security/compliance/test_owasp_top10.py`

- [ ] **Perform LLM-specific security testing**
  - Prompt injection attempts
  - Output manipulation tests
  - PII extraction attempts
  - Action: Execute AI security test suite

### ðŸš¨ Critical: Production Readiness Verification
