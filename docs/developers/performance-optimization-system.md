## Core Components

### 1. Adaptive Cache Manager

The `EnhancedCacheManager` provides ML-driven cache optimization with multiple sophistication levels:

#### Key Features
- **Multi-tier Architecture**: L1 (local) and L2 (distributed) caching
- **ML-driven Optimization**: Predictive prefetching and adaptive TTL management
- **Access Pattern Analysis**: Statistical analysis of cache usage patterns
- **Automated Optimization**: Real-time cache performance tuning

#### Implementation
```python
from src.services.cache.adaptive_cache import EnhancedCacheManager

# Initialize with ML optimization
cache_manager = EnhancedCacheManager(
    enable_adaptive_optimization=True,
    enable_specialized_caches=True
)

# Start automatic optimization
await cache_manager.start_adaptive_optimization()

# Get optimization analytics
analytics = await cache_manager.get_optimization_analytics()
```

#### ML Optimization Engine
- **Access Frequency Prediction**: Uses linear models to predict cache access probability
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies hot/cold data patterns using statistical analysis
- **Adaptive TTL**: Dynamically adjusts cache TTL based on access patterns
- **Intelligent Eviction**: Cost-benefit analysis for cache eviction decisions

### 2. Async Performance Optimizer

The `AsyncPerformanceOptimizer` implements intelligent concurrency management:

#### Key Features
- **Adaptive Concurrency Limiting**: Dynamic adjustment based on system resources
- **Priority-based Task Scheduling**: Intelligent task queuing with priority levels
- **Resource-aware Execution**: CPU and memory aware task execution
- **Backpressure Detection**: Automatic scaling based on performance metrics

#### Implementation
```python
from src.services.performance import initialize_async_optimizer, TaskPriority

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = await initialize_async_optimizer(
    initial_concurrency=10,
    enable_adaptive_limiting=True,
    enable_intelligent_scheduling=True
)

# Execute with optimization
result = await optimizer.execute_optimized(
    my_coroutine(),
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH
)

# Batch execution with priority
results = await optimizer.execute_batch_optimized(
    [coro1(), coro2(), coro3()],
    priority=TaskPriority.NORMAL
)
```

#### Adaptive Algorithms
- **Concurrency Scaling**: Increases/decreases concurrency based on performance metrics

#### Implementation
```python
from src.services.performance import run_performance_benchmark, LoadTestConfig

# Configure load test
config = LoadTestConfig(
    initial_rps=1.0,
    max_rps=100.0,
    sustain_duration=30.0,
    success_threshold=0.95
)

# Run comprehensive benchmark

    features = np.array([
        pattern.access_frequency,  # How often accessed
        1.0 / max(current_time - pattern.last_access, 1),  # Recency
        max(pattern.trend_slope, 0),  # Positive trend
        time_of_day_pattern(current_time),  # Temporal patterns
    ])
    
    # Linear model prediction
    prediction = np.dot(access_predictor_weights, features)
    return sigmoid(prediction) * pattern.prediction_confidence
```

```python
async def adjust_concurrency_limit(self) -> None:
    # Resource utilization check

    # Performance metrics
    error_rate = self.failed_tasks / max(self.total_tasks, 1)
    avg_latency = self.avg_execution_time
    
    # Adaptive scaling decision
    if (cpu_percent < 80 and memory_percent < 85 and 
        error_rate < 0.05 and avg_latency < target_latency):
        # Scale up
        self.current_limit = min(self.current_limit * 1.1, self.max_limit)
    elif (cpu_percent > 90 or memory_percent > 90 or
          error_rate > 0.1 or avg_latency > target_latency * 2):
        # Scale down
