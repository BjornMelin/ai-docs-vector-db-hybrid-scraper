# Developer Documentation

Use this hub to develop against, extend, and maintain the AI Docs Vector DB platform. The
sections below link to the key guides and reference material that engineers rely on every day.

## Quick Navigation

### Getting Started

- **[Getting Started](./getting-started.md)** – Set up the local environment and project tooling
- **[Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md)** – Patterns for embedding the platform into client
  applications
- **[Contributing](./contributing.md)** – Code style, testing expectations, and review workflow

### Technical References

- **[API Reference](./api-reference.md)** – REST, browser automation, and MCP endpoints
- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** – System design, data flow, and component responsibilities
- **[Configuration](./configuration.md)** – Environment variables, service defaults, and tuning knobs
- **[Deployment Strategies](./deployment-strategies.md)** – Blue/green, canary, and feature flag rollout
  practices

## What You'll Find Here

### Development Environment

- Supported runtimes (Python 3.11–3.12) and prerequisite tooling
- Local development via Docker and helper scripts
- Test suite layout and quality gates
- CI/CD workflow across Linux, Windows, and macOS

### API Integration

- REST and streaming APIs with authentication examples
- Browser automation and RAG orchestration interfaces
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) adapters and tooling
- Error handling, retries, and rate limiting guidance

### System Architecture

- High-level architecture diagrams and component boundaries
- Message flow across ingestion, processing, and retrieval services
- Scaling guidance for hybrid search pipelines
- Security controls applied at each layer

### Advanced Topics

- Extending embedding models and adapters
- Performance profiling and tuning playbooks
- Observability instrumentation and alerting
- Plugin and extension points for custom integrations

## Development Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-docs-vector-db-hybrid-scraper
./setup.sh  # optional helper; see Getting Started for manual steps

# Start development services
python scripts/dev.py services start
```

```bash
# Health check
curl localhost:6333/health

# Basic search test
curl -X POST localhost:8000/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test search", "limit": 5}'
```

```python
# Minimal Python integration example (update import to the published client package)
from ai_docs_client import VectorDBClient

client = VectorDBClient("http://localhost:8000")
print(client.search("your query"))
```

## Developer Personas

### API Integrators

Deliver applications that call the platform.
→ Start with [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md) and [API Reference](./api-reference.md)

### System Contributors

Add features or fix issues within the platform.
→ Start with [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) and [Contributing](./contributing.md)

### DevOps Engineers

Operate the platform in production.
→ Review [Architecture](./architecture.md) and the [Operator Documentation](../operators/index.md)

### Platform Engineers

Embed the platform inside internal tooling.
→ Focus on [API Reference](./api-reference.md) and [Configuration](./configuration.md)

## Common Development Tasks

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Follow prerequisites in [Getting Started](./getting-started.md)
2. Use helper scripts or manual steps to install dependencies
3. Run the unit and integration test suites
4. Launch sample integrations to confirm connectivity

### Building an Integration

1. Read [API Reference](./api-reference.md) for supported operations
2. Review [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md) for patterns and code samples
3. Configure authentication and rate limiting
4. Implement structured error handling and retries

### Contributing Code

1. Read [Contributing](./contributing.md)
2. Create a feature branch and follow coding guidelines
3. Run tests locally and ensure linting passes
4. Submit a pull request with clear context and validation steps

### Performance Tuning

1. Review [Architecture](./architecture.md) for pipeline details
2. Check [Configuration](./configuration.md) for tunable parameters
3. Use [Performance Benchmarking Methodology](./performance-benchmarking-methodology.md) for repeatable tests
4. Coordinate rollouts with the [Operations Runbook](../operators/operations.md)
