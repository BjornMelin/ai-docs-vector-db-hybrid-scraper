## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Strategy

### Technical Interview Preparation

**System Design Questions**:

```
Q: "Design a scalable document search system"
A: "I actually built this. Let me walk you through the 5-tier browser
automation, hybrid vector search, and ML-enhanced infrastructure components.
The key insight was intelligent tier routing based on content complexity..."
```

**Performance Optimization Questions**:

```
Q: "How would you optimize a slow API?"
A: "I improved API throughput by 887% through systematic optimization.
First, I profiled to identify bottlenecks: database connections, embedding
generation, and vector search. Then I implemented predictive connection
pooling, batch processing, and semantic caching..."
```

**Architecture Questions**:

```
Q: "How do you design for reliability?"
A: "My system achieves 99.9% uptime through layered reliability patterns:
ML-powered circuit breakers for predictive failure detection, self-healing
infrastructure with automatic recovery, and comprehensive monitoring with
alerting. The key is designing for failure, not hoping it won't happen."
```

### Behavioral Interview Stories

**"Tell me about a challenging technical problem"**:

```
"I needed to achieve sub-100ms search latency while maintaining 96% accuracy.
The challenge was balancing speed vs. quality. I implemented hybrid search
with dense+sparse vectors, added semantic caching for 86% hit rate, and
optimized HNSW parameters. The result was 50% latency reduction while
improving accuracy."
```

**"Describe a time you had to make technical trade-offs"**:

```
"When designing the embedding strategy, I chose multi-provider routing over
single provider lock-in. This added complexity but provided cost optimization
and reliability. I implemented intelligent routing based on cost, accuracy,
and availability requirements, reducing embedding costs by 40% while
maintaining quality."
```

**"How do you ensure code quality?"**:

```
"I implemented comprehensive testing with 1000+ tests, including property-based
testing with Hypothesis. The system achieves 90%+ coverage with realistic test
scenarios, not just line coverage. I also added performance benchmarking,
security scanning, and chaos engineering tests."
