# Thread Safety Fixes for Drift Detection

## Overview

Fixed race conditions in the configuration drift detection system by implementing proper thread-safe locking mechanisms using Python's `threading.RLock` and `asyncio.Lock`.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Concurrent access to `self._snapshots`** - Multiple threads could modify the snapshots dictionary simultaneously
2. **Concurrent access to `self._drift_events`** - Event list could be corrupted during concurrent append operations
3. **Concurrent access to `self._last_alert_times`** - Alert rate limiting could fail under concurrent access

## Implementation Details

### Lock Types Used

- **`threading.RLock` (Re-entrant Lock)**: Used for all synchronous operations
  - `self._snapshots_lock`: Protects snapshot dictionary access
  - `self._events_lock`: Protects drift events list access
  - `self._alerts_lock`: Protects alert tracking dictionary access
  
- **`asyncio.Lock`**: Added for future async operation compatibility
  - `self._async_lock`: Ready for async method implementations

### Protected Operations

1. **Snapshot Management**
   - `take_snapshot()`: Protected snapshot storage with `_snapshots_lock`
   - `compare_snapshots()`: Protected snapshot reading with `_snapshots_lock`
   - `_cleanup_old_snapshots()`: Protected cleanup operations with `_snapshots_lock`

2. **Event Management**
   - Event appending in `compare_snapshots()`: Protected with `_events_lock`
   - `_cleanup_old_events()`: Protected cleanup with `_events_lock`
   - `get_drift_summary()`: Protected event reading with `_events_lock`

3. **Alert Rate Limiting**
   - `should_alert()`: Protected alert time tracking with `_alerts_lock`

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Copy data before processing**: In `compare_snapshots()`, we copy the snapshots list to avoid holding locks during long operations
2. **Minimal lock scope**: Locks are acquired only for the minimal critical sections
3. **Re-entrant locks**: Using `RLock` allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times
4. **Consistent lock ordering**: Prevents deadlocks by maintaining consistent lock acquisition order

## Testing

Created comprehensive concurrency tests in `tests/test_drift_detection_concurrency.py` that verify:

- Concurrent snapshot creation
- Concurrent drift detection
- Concurrent alert rate limiting
- Concurrent cleanup operations
- Concurrent summary generation
- ThreadPoolExecutor compatibility
- Async operation compatibility
- High contention scenarios

## Performance Considerations

- Locks add minimal overhead for normal operations
- Re-entrant locks allow nested method calls without deadlock
- Lock contention is minimized by keeping critical sections small
- Copying data before processing reduces lock hold time
