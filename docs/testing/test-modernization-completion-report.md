    style D fill:#51cf66
    style E fill:#51cf66
```

### 2. Test Categorization System

- **Unit Tests**: `@pytest.mark.unit` - Pure logic, no I/O
- **Integration Tests**: `@pytest.mark.integration` - Service boundaries
- **E2E Tests**: `@pytest.mark.e2e` - Full user journeys
- **Performance Tests**: `@pytest.mark.performance` - Benchmarks
- **Security Tests**: `@pytest.mark.security` - Vulnerability checks
- **AI Tests**: `@pytest.mark.ai` - ML model validation

### 3. Modern Fixture Patterns

```python
# Before: Legacy fixtures
def test_something():
    db = create_db()
    cache = create_cache()
    try:
        # test logic
    finally:
        cleanup_db(db)
        cleanup_cache(cache)

# After: Modern fixtures
@pytest.fixture
async def db_fixture():
    async with create_async_db() as db:
        yield db

@pytest.fixture
async def cache_fixture():
    async with create_async_cache() as cache:
        yield cache

async def test_something(db_fixture, cache_fixture):
    # Clean, isolated test logic
```

[tool:pytest]
minversion = 7.0
addopts = 
    --strict-markers
    --strict-config
    --cov=src
    --cov-fail-under=80
    --maxfail=5
    -n auto
    --dist loadgroup
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: pytest-fast
        name: Fast Tests
        entry: uv run pytest -m "not slow"
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
```

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

- Performance regression detection
- Test flakiness tracking
- Coverage trend analysis
- Execution time monitoring

## Recommendations

3. Implement performance budgets
4. Set up automated test quality checks

### Medium-term Goals
1. Expand property-based testing coverage
2. Implement chaos engineering tests
3. Add visual regression testing
4. Enhance AI model testing

### Long-term Vision
1. Self-healing test infrastructure
2. AI-powered test generation
3. Predictive test selection
4. Zero-maintenance testing
