# Phase 0 Inventory Summary

## Highlights
- Generated `inventory.csv` with 951 tracked artifacts (markdown: 157, reStructuredText: 98, JSON: 5, YAML: 2, Python inline-doc candidates: 689).
- Audience tagging shows concentration in `general` (452 items) and code/test-linked `qa` assets (362), with developer-facing doc counts lagging (42 items).
- Detected dual generators: MkDocs (`docs/build-config/mkdocs.yml`) and Sphinx (`docs/build-config/conf.py`); no Docusaurus traces located.
- Link analysis captured 100 broken/anchor-missing references across 67 source files (see `link_map.json`).
- Identified 108 potential orphaned docs primarily within `docs/api/` auto-generated trees and stale high-level guides.
- Flagged 104 compliance-sensitive candidates mentioning security, retention, or audit keywords.

## Immediate Observations
- The Sphinx API tree under `docs/api/` appears unreferenced from the primary navigation, pointing to safe archival potential after traceability confirmation.
- Root `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` both contain stale intra-repo anchors (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, missing section IDs) that should be remediated during Phase 3 clean-up.
- Multiple operator guides reference headings in umbrella index files that no longer exist (e.g., `docs/operators/configuration.md`).
- Planning dossiers in `planning/done/` remain unlinked but may retain legacy compliance value; decision needed during mapping.

## Research Queue (Context7 / Exa / Firecrawl)
1. MkDocs + Sphinx coexistence: recommended consolidation path and migration playbooks.
2. Traceability matrices that bridge requirements ↔ ADRs ↔ tests (modern references, IEEE/INCOSE guidance).
3. Documentation retention & archival policies for AI/ML systems with compliance-sensitive content.
4. Best practices for pruning legacy auto-generated API docs while preserving regeneration steps.
5. Link governance automation in large MkDocs/Sphinx hybrid estates.

## Next Actions
- Inventory coverage reconfirmed at 100 % after rerunning `doc_inventory.py`; keep periodic spot-check as Phase 0 control.
- Prioritize anchor fix backlog during Phase 3 migrations; track in future `mapping.csv`.
- Classify orphaned `docs/api/` files into archive vs. regenerate buckets once requirements/ADR scaffolding is in place.
- Feed compliance candidate list into Phase 1 policy drafting to ensure retention decisions factor regulatory keyword hits.
