  ```python
  # Tiered architecture: Tier 0 (httpx+BeautifulSoup) → Tier 1 (Crawl4AI) → Tier 2 (Playwright)
  class LightweightScraper:
      async def attempt_simple_scrape(self, url: str) -> Optional[ScrapedContent]:
          # 5-10x faster for static pages
  ```
- **Benefits**: 5-10x speed improvement for static pages, 30% overall performance gain
- **Location**: `src/services/crawling/lightweight_provider.py` (new)

#### **Week 2: Intelligence & Anti-Detection**

**Task 3: Enhanced Anti-Detection System** `feat/enhanced-anti-detection`
- **Research Impact**: 8.9 → 9.3 score improvement
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  class EnhancedAntiDetection:
      def get_stealth_config(self, site_profile: str) -> BrowserConfig:
          # Sophisticated fingerprint management
          # 95%+ success rate on challenging sites
  ```
- **Benefits**: 95%+ success rate on challenging sites (vs current ~85%)
- **Location**: `src/services/crawling/anti_detection.py` (new)

**Task 4: Content Intelligence Service** `feat/content-intelligence`
- **Research Impact**: 8.9 → 9.5 score improvement
- **Timeline**: 3-4 days
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  class ContentIntelligenceService:
      async def analyze_content(self, result: CrawlResult) -> EnrichedContent:
          # Lightweight semantic analysis using local models
          # Automatic adaptation to site changes
  ```
- **Benefits**: Automatic adaptation to site changes, improved extraction quality
- **Location**: `src/services/crawling/content_intelligence.py` (new)

#### **Week 3: Integration & Testing**
