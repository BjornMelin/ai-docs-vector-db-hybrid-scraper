# Transformation Research

Background material for the architecture and performance modernization initiative that reduced
configuration complexity and unified the service container. The implementation is complete; use this
folder as historical reference when tracing design decisions.

## Contents

- `master_report.md` â€“ Final summary of transformation outcomes
- Sub-agent logs and execution plans in `archive/`
- Supporting analyses for performance, security, and deployment improvements

## How to Use

- Consult when reviewing the rationale behind the unified configuration system and dependency
  injection container.
- Use as evidence when drafting ADRs or explaining legacy design choices.
- New improvements should record their reasoning via ADRs instead of expanding this folder.
