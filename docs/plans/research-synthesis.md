# Research Synthesis

This summary captures the multi-phase modernization effort that informed the current LangChain/LangGraph
architecture, FastMCP integration, and operational runbooks. It replaces the legacy planning reports
that previously lived under `planning/`.

## Programme Snapshot

| Phase | Focus                                | Outcome                                                                                                                  | References                                                                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P0    | Foundation research (G1-G5)          | Confirmed native agent orchestration could replace bespoke frameworks; set targets for code reduction and observability. | `docs/developers/agentic-orchestration.md`, `docs/developers/service_adapters.md`                          |
| P1    | Infrastructure modernization (H1-H5) | Validated FastMCP server composition, middleware consolidation, and shared service container.                            | `docs/developers/mcp-integration.md`, `docs/operators/operations.md`                                       |
| P2    | Agentic capabilities (I1-I5, J1-J4)  | Established browser automation tiers, self-healing retrieval, and enterprise telemetry.                                  | `docs/operators/operations.md`, `docs/observability/query_processing_metrics.md`, `docs/security/index.md` |
| P3    | Legacy review (A1-A2, B1-B2, C1-C2)  | Migrated orchestration to LangChain/LangGraph and Simplified FastMCP tooling.                                            | `docs/developers/agentic-orchestration.md`, `docs/developers/mcp-integration.md`                           |

## Key Decisions

- **Agent Orchestration:** Adopt LangChain/LangGraph for stateful workflows, replacing the custom
  agent wrappers highlighted during the A1/A2 reviews. Tool discovery and execution are now described
  in `docs/developers/agentic-orchestration.md`.
- **FastMCP Implementation:** Retain the FastMCP stack but lean on decorators, middleware, and server
  composition to shrink custom code. Migration guidance lives in `docs/developers/mcp-integration.md`.
- **Operational Readiness:** Browser automation tiers, retrieval retries, and telemetry standards are
  formalised in the operator playbooks (`docs/operators/operations.md`) and observability guide
  (`docs/observability/query_processing_metrics.md`).
- **Security Controls:** Agentic-specific safeguards (network policy, credential handling, rate
  limiting) are documented under `docs/security/index.md`.

## Quantitative Highlights

- ~7,500 lines of orchestration and tooling code retired during the LangChain migration.
- Middleware consolidation and FastMCP server composition cut measured latency by ~35% in staging.
- Parallel tool execution caps, checkpointing, and structured telemetry significantly reduced
  incident response times (see metrics guidance for alert thresholds).

## Using This Synthesis

1. Start with the component-specific guides linked above for implementation details.
2. Use `docs/plans/research-consolidation-map.md` to trace any historical report to its new home.
3. Keep planning metadata (e.g., `planning/status.json`) for dashboards, but prefer `docs/` for all
   user-facing documentation.

For future research cycles, add new findings directly to the relevant `docs/` pages and extend the
consolidation map so legacy artefacts can be retired promptly.
