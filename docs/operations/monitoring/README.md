# Monitoring & Troubleshooting

> **Purpose**: System health monitoring and issue resolution  
> **Audience**: Operations teams and on-call engineers

## Monitoring Documentation

### Issue Resolution
- [**Troubleshooting**](../operations/monitoring/troubleshooting.md) - Common problems and step-by-step solutions

## Monitoring Strategy

### Health Monitoring

**System Health**:
- Service availability and responsiveness
- Database connectivity and performance
- Cache hit rates and effectiveness
- Background job processing status

**Application Metrics**:
- Search query latency and throughput
- Document processing rates
- Error rates by endpoint
- User session and request patterns

**Infrastructure Metrics**:
- CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- Network bandwidth and latency
- Container health and resource limits
- Database query performance

## Alert Thresholds

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Search latency >500ms (95th percentile)
- Error rate >5%
- System uptime <99%
- Database connection failures

### Warning Alerts (Response within 30 minutes)
- Search latency >200ms (95th percentile)
- Error rate >1%
- Memory usage >85%
- Disk usage >90%

## Monitoring Tools

### Built-in Monitoring
```bash
# Health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Detailed metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics

# System diagnostics
curl http://localhost:8000/diagnostics
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Application logs
docker logs ai-docs-vector-db

# Search for errors
grep -i "error" /var/log/ai-docs/*.log

# Performance analysis
grep "latency" /var/log/ai-docs/performance.log
```

## Troubleshooting Workflow

1. **Identify** - Use monitoring dashboards to detect issues
2. **Triage** - Assess severity and impact
3. **Investigate** - Use logs and metrics to find root cause
4. **Resolve** - Apply appropriate fixes
5. **Verify** - Confirm issue resolution
6. **Document** - Update troubleshooting guides
