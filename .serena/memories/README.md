# Serena Project Memories

This directory contains project-specific memories and patterns for the AI Documentation Vector Database Hybrid Scraper project.

## Memory Organization

### `documentation-organization.md`
Project documentation architecture decisions, hierarchy structure, and maintenance patterns.

### `research-patterns.md` 
Research documentation lifecycle, integration patterns, and archival strategies.

### `quality-standards.md`
Documentation quality standards, review processes, and continuous improvement patterns.

## Usage Guidelines

These memories help maintain consistency across:
- Documentation structure and organization
- Research project lifecycle management  
- Quality assurance and validation processes
- Cross-team collaboration patterns

Memories should be updated when:
- Documentation structure changes
- New research domains are added
- Quality standards evolve
- Integration patterns are established

## Integration with Main Documentation

Memories complement the main documentation by capturing:
- **Decision Context**: Why certain choices were made
- **Process Knowledge**: How to maintain and evolve the documentation
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked well and what didn't
- **Future Considerations**: Areas for improvement and evolution
