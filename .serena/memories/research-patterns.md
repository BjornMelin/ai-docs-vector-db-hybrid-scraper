# Research Documentation Patterns

## Research Lifecycle Management

### Phase Structure
1. **Initiation**: Create domain directory with README.md overview
2. **Active Development**: Maintain current implementation documents
3. **Version Management**: Archive outdated approaches in versioned subdirectories
4. **Integration**: Feed findings into main documentation (users/, developers/, operators/)
5. **Completion**: Archive final state and lessons learned

### Directory Naming Conventions
- Domain-based: `browser-use/`, `transformation/`, `performance-optimization/`
- Version archival: `archive/v1-original/`, `archive/v2-enterprise/`
- Detailed analysis: `archive/detailed-reports/`

### Document Status Headers
```markdown
> **Status**: [Active|Complete|Archived]  
> **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
> **Timeline**: [Duration and milestones]  
> **Focus**: [Primary objectives]
```

## Integration Patterns

### Research → Main Documentation Flow
- **User Impact**: Research findings affecting end-users → `docs/users/`
- **Technical Implementation**: Developer-focused details → `docs/developers/`
- **Operations Impact**: Deployment/configuration changes → `docs/operators/`

### Archive Strategy
- Preserve historical context in `archive/` subdirectories
- Maintain detailed analysis reports for future reference
- Version-specific implementations for comparison and rollback

## Current Active Research

### Browser-Use Enhancement (Active)
- Status: V3 Solo Developer approach
- Timeline: 12-16 weeks
- Archive: V1 original analysis, V2 enterprise approach

### Portfolio ULTRATHINK Transformation (85% Complete)
- Status: Ready for final implementation 
- Focus: System architecture modernization
- Archive: Comprehensive detailed reports and analysis

## Quality Standards

### Research Document Requirements
- Clear status and timeline information
- Structured archive organization
- Integration points with main documentation
- Version history preservation

### Review Process
- Research documents reviewed for integration opportunities
- Archive organization validated during major milestones
- Cross-references maintained with main documentation

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Well
- Domain-based organization provides clear boundaries
- Version archival preserves decision context
- Status headers enable quick navigation
- Integration flow prevents research isolation

### Areas for Improvement
- Automated link validation needed
- Better cross-reference management
- Research completion criteria standardization
