# Documentation Organization Memory

## Project Context
AI Documentation Vector Database Hybrid Scraper - Enterprise-grade AI RAG system with comprehensive documentation structure.

## Documentation Architecture Decisions

### Hierarchy Structure
1. **Audience-First Organization**: docs/ organized by Users, Developers, Operators
2. **Research Consolidation**: docs/research/ with domain-specific subdirectories
3. **Clear Information Architecture**: Logical hierarchy from general to specific
4. **Consistent Navigation**: Cross-references and internal linking standards

### Research Documentation Standards
- Domain-based organization (browser-use/, transformation/)
- Archive structure for version management (v1-original/, v2-enterprise/, detailed-reports/)
- Status-based classification (Active, Complete, Archived)
- Consistent document headers with status, timeline, and focus

### File Naming Conventions
- kebab-case for all filenames
- Version numbers where relevant (v3-solo-dev-guide.md)
- Domain prefixes for clarity (transformation-master-plan.md)
- README.md files for directory overviews

### Integration Points
Research findings integrate into main docs based on audience impact:
- User impact → docs/users/
- Developer impact → docs/developers/
- Operational impact → docs/operators/

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Research directory structure reorganized
- ✅ Documentation standards established
- ❌ Internal link validation (in progress)
- ❌ README.md updates (pending)

## Next Actions
1. Fix internal documentation links
2. Update main README.md documentation references
3. Validate research document organization
4. Create .serena/memories/ structure for project-specific documentation patterns
