  - Registry initialization, tool registration, lookup, and error handling
- [ ] Create new unit tests for each module in `src/mcp/tools/` to verify:
  - Public helper function imports and basic execution with mock inputs for utilities, collections, search, embeddings, documents, and cache
  - Proper error handling for invalid parameters or missing dependencies

- tests/unit/services/test_qdrant_service_facade.py
- tests/unit/services/test_browser_use_adapter.py

**Findings:**

- Tests in this group fail with permission errors due to asyncio event loop creation in container environments.
- Many tests assume legacy combined service implementation and cover outdated workflows, making them incompatible with current modular `src/services` structure.
- Coverage for `src/services` cannot be evaluated because tests error out before execution.

**Actionable TODOs:**

- [ ] Remove the `tests/unit/services/` directory and all contained test files.
- [ ] Create new unit tests for each module in `src/services`, including:
  - core modules (`base.py`, `errors.py`, `logging_config.py`)
  - utilities (`rate_limiter.py`, `hnsw_optimizer.py`, `search_models.py`)
  - crawling providers and manager (`crawling/base.py`, `crawling/manager.py`, `crawling/crawl4ai_provider.py`, `crawling/firecrawl_provider.py`)
  - vector_db components (`vector_db/client.py`, `vector_db/collections.py`, `vector_db/documents.py`, `vector_db/search.py`, `vector_db/service.py`, `vector_db/indexing.py`)
  - hyde modules (`hyde/config.py`, `hyde/engine.py`, `hyde/cache.py`, `hyde/generator.py`)
  - browser adapters and schemas (`browser/action_schemas.py`, `browser/playwright_adapter.py`, `browser/crawl4ai_adapter.py`, `browser/automation_router.py`, `browser/browser_use_adapter.py`)
  - embeddings providers and manager (`embeddings/base.py`, `embeddings/openai_provider.py`, `embeddings/fastembed_provider.py`, `embeddings/manager.py`)
  - cache systems (`cache/base.py`, `cache/local_cache.py`, `cache/search_cache.py`, `cache/embedding_cache.py`, `cache/manager.py`, `cache/patterns.py`, `cache/dragonfly_cache.py`, `cache/warming.py`, `cache/metrics.py`)
  - deployment strategies (`deployment/ab_testing.py`, `deployment/blue_green.py`, `deployment/canary.py`)
- [ ] Ensure new tests achieve ≥90% coverage for `src/services`.

## Cleanup Tasks - Remove Legacy Test Directories

**Directories to remove:**

- tests/unit/infrastructure/ (outdated, needs replacement)
- tests/unit/utils/ (outdated, needs replacement)  
- tests/unit/services/ (massive directory with failing tests)
- tests/fixtures/ (empty directory with no fixtures)
- tests/integration/ (broken tests, needs redesign)
- tests/performance/ (broken tests, needs redesign)

**Actionable TODOs:**

- [ ] Remove `tests/unit/infrastructure/` directory and all contained test files
- [ ] Remove `tests/unit/utils/` directory and all contained test files
- [ ] Remove `tests/unit/services/` directory and all contained test files
- [ ] Remove `tests/fixtures/` directory
- [ ] Remove `tests/integration/` directory (redesign as E2E tests separately)
- [ ] Remove `tests/performance/` directory (redesign with pytest-benchmark)
- [ ] Remove legacy test files in config and MCP directories

## New Test Implementation Needed

**Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Write new unit tests for `src/infrastructure/client_manager.py`
- [ ] Write new unit tests for `src/services/core/project_storage.py`

**Unified Architecture:**
- [ ] Remove `tests/unit/test_unified_architecture.py`
- [ ] Implement new unit tests for `src/unified_mcp_server.py` covering:
  - Server lifecycle context (initialization and cleanup)
  - Transport selection logic in `__main__`
  - Integration points with client manager and tool registration

**Services (Major Work Required):**
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for `src/services/` modules:
  - Core modules (base.py, errors.py, logging_config.py)
  - Vector DB components (client.py, collections.py, documents.py, search.py, service.py, indexing.py)
  - Embedding providers (openai_provider.py, fastembed_provider.py, manager.py)
  - Cache systems (local_cache.py, search_cache.py, embedding_cache.py, manager.py, dragonfly_cache.py)
  - Crawling providers (crawl4ai_provider.py, firecrawl_provider.py, manager.py)
  - Browser automation (playwright_adapter.py, crawl4ai_adapter.py, automation_router.py)
  - HyDE modules (engine.py, cache.py, generator.py, config.py)
  - Utilities (rate_limiter.py, hnsw_optimizer.py, search_models.py)
  - Deployment strategies (ab_testing.py, blue_green.py, canary.py)

## Summary: Test Suite Reorganization

### ✅ MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
- **27 new test files created** with 440+ passing tests
- **High-priority modules completed**: All domain models, API contracts, configuration models
- **>90% coverage achieved** on all completed modules
- **Pydantic v2 best practices** implemented throughout

### 🔧 IMMEDIATE CLEANUP NEEDED (High Priority)
1. **Remove legacy test directories** that contain broken/outdated tests
2. **Implement core module tests** (config, MCP tools, infrastructure)
3. **Create services test suite** (largest remaining work)

### 📋 TESTING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

**Phase 1: Cleanup (Immediate)**
- Remove all legacy test directories to eliminate confusion
- Clean up broken test files in existing directories

**Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)**  
- Complete config core modules (loader, schema, validator, migrator, cli)
- Implement MCP tool registry and tools tests
- Add infrastructure and unified server tests

**Phase 3: Services Architecture (Major Project)**
- Design comprehensive test strategy for services/ modules
- Implement with proper mocking and async handling
- Target >90% coverage for all service modules

**Phase 4: Integration & E2E (Future)**
- Redesign integration tests as proper E2E tests
- Implement with pytest-benchmark for performance testing
- Separate from unit test pipeline

## Testing documentation review

**Documents:**

- docs/development/TESTING_QUALITY_ENHANCEMENTS.md

**Findings:**

- Testing documentation references an outdated test directory structure (e.g., tests/unit/test_services, test_providers, etc.) that no longer matches the current project layout under tests/unit/{config,mcp,services,infrastructure,utils}.
- Usage examples for pytest fixtures and manual event_loop setup conflict with simpler pytest-asyncio defaults and our uv-managed `uv run` workflow.
- Command-line instructions (pytest-cov, coverage, etc.) do not reflect the `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff` or pre-commit hooks defined in pyproject.toml.
- Documentation does not include new linting, formatting, and virtual environment guidelines (uv, ruff, pre-commit).

**Actionable TODOs:**

- [ ] Update docs/development/TESTING_QUALITY_ENHANCEMENTS.md to align with:
  - Current tests layout under tests/unit, integration, performance, and e2e directories (if any).
  - `uv run pytest --cov=src` and `uv run ruff --fix` workflows.
  - pytest-asyncio plugin defaults without manual event_loop fixtures unless explicitly needed.
  - Updated conftest.py fixtures for shared mocks and AsyncClient usage.
- [ ] Remove or archive references to deprecated test fixtures and examples in TESTING_QUALITY_ENHANCEMENTS.md.
