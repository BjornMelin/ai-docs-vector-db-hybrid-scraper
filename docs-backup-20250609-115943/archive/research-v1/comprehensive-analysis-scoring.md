    scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy()  # Faster alternative
)
```

**Benefits**: 20-30% performance improvement, better resource utilization

#### 2. Lightweight HTTP Tier Addition (Impact: High, Complexity: Low)

**Research Insight**: External analysis confirmed need for simple static page optimization

**Recommended Implementation:**

```python
class LightweightScraper:
    async def attempt_simple_scrape(self, url: str) -> Optional[ScrapedContent]:
        # Quick HEAD request to determine content type
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            head_response = await client.head(url)
            if self._is_simple_static(head_response):
                response = await client.get(url)
                soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')
                return self._extract_content(soup)
        return None
```

**Benefits**: 5-10x faster for simple static pages, reduced resource usage

        return BrowserConfig(
            headers=self._generate_realistic_headers(),
            viewport=(
                random.randint(1200, 1920),
                random.randint(800, 1080)
            ),
            user_agent=self._rotate_user_agents(),
