# Consolidated Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been consolidated into comprehensive user guides following the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle.

## Files Moved and Consolidated

### Browser Automation Documentation → [docs/user-guides/browser-automation.md](../../user-guides/browser-automation.md)

**Consolidated Files:**
- `07_BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md` (870 lines) - Browser automation implementation guide
  - **Original Location**: `docs/REFACTOR/07_BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md`
  - **Content**: 3-tier browser automation hierarchy, AutomationRouter implementation, BrowserUseAdapter code
- `browser-automation-architecture-review.md` (157 lines) - Architecture review and gap analysis  
  - **Original Location**: `docs/research/reviews/browser-automation-architecture-review.md`
  - **Content**: Integration gaps, disconnected systems analysis, action items

**New Consolidated Guide:**
- Updated from 3-tier to 5-tier architecture (including Tier 0: Lightweight HTTP)
- Complete implementation code for all components
- Site-specific optimizations and configurations
- Performance monitoring and troubleshooting sections
- Integration examples and best practices

### Crawl4AI Documentation → [docs/user-guides/crawl4ai.md](../../user-guides/crawl4ai.md)

**Consolidated Files:**
- `05_CRAWL4AI_INTEGRATION.md` (582 lines) - Implementation guide and migration from Firecrawl
  - **Original Location**: `docs/REFACTOR/05_CRAWL4AI_INTEGRATION.md`
  - **Content**: Core integration code, JavaScript execution, content extraction optimization
- `CRAWL4AI_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` (667 lines) - Configuration examples with Memory-Adaptive Dispatcher
  - **Original Location**: `docs/features/CRAWL4AI_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`
  - **Content**: Basic/advanced configs, Memory-Adaptive Dispatcher, site-specific settings, monitoring
- `CRAWL4AI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (621 lines) - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
  - **Original Location**: `docs/operations/CRAWL4AI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - **Content**: Installation issues, browser problems, performance optimization, debugging techniques

**New Consolidated Guide:**
- Complete lifecycle: installation → configuration → implementation → troubleshooting
- Memory-Adaptive Dispatcher integration and optimization
- Performance monitoring with Prometheus integration
- Migration strategies from Firecrawl
- Integration examples with embedding pipeline

### Legacy Documentation

**Archived Files:**
- `FIRECRAWL_DEPENDENCY_EVALUATION.md` (202 lines) - Firecrawl removal evaluation
  - **Original Location**: `docs/operations/FIRECRAWL_DEPENDENCY_EVALUATION.md`
  - **Content**: Performance comparison, migration strategy, recommendation to keep as optional dependency
  - **Status**: Legacy - Firecrawl now optional, Crawl4AI is primary provider

## Consolidation Benefits

### Before Consolidation
- **4+ overlapping files** for browser automation across different directories
- **3+ overlapping files** for Crawl4AI configuration and troubleshooting
- **Information scattered** across REFACTOR/, features/, operations/, research/ directories
- **Outdated architecture** references (3-tier vs implemented 5-tier)
- **Duplicate content** and inconsistent information

### After Consolidation
- **Single source of truth** for each major topic
- **Updated architecture** documentation reflecting 5-tier system
- **Comprehensive guides** covering full lifecycle of each component
- **Consistent information** and cross-references between guides
- **Improved maintainability** with SSOT principle
