## 🔧 Technical Issues Found

### Infrastructure Issues
1. **Missing Dependencies**: PyJWT for security testing (resolved)
2. **Import Errors**: SecurityError, SecurityValidator (resolved)  
3. **Pytest Markers**: Missing 'disaster_recovery' marker (resolved)
4. **Configuration Validation**: Chunking config validation logic errors

### Test Quality Issues
1. **Flaky Tests**: 10 config tests failing due to environment assumptions
2. **Mock Overuse**: Many tests use mocks instead of real integration
3. **Test Isolation**: Environment variable pollution between tests
