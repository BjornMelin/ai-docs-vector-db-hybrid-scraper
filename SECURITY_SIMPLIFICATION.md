# Security Simplification Summary

## Overview

The security configuration has been simplified from a complex 969-line implementation to a focused 290-line module that leverages FastAPI's built-in security features and standard libraries.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Complex Features
- ❌ Custom encryption implementations
- ❌ Complex key management systems
- ❌ Custom audit logging (use standard logging)
- ❌ Over-engineered access control systems
- ❌ Configuration encryption at rest
- ❌ HashiCorp Vault integration
- ❌ Digital signatures
- ❌ Hardware security module support

### 2. Simplified Implementation

#### JWT Authentication (`src/services/security.py`)
- Uses `pyjwt` for token creation/validation
- Simple bearer token authentication
- FastAPI dependency injection for protected routes

#### Password Security
- Uses `passlib` with bcrypt for password hashing
- Standard verify/hash functions

#### Input Validation
- Basic URL validation to prevent common attacks
- Filename sanitization for safe file operations
- Compatible with existing `SecurityValidator` interface

#### Rate Limiting
- Simple in-memory rate limiter
- Can be replaced with Redis in production

### 3. Security Configuration (`src/config/core.py`)

Updated the basic `SecurityConfig` to include:
- Core security settings (enabled, allowed/blocked domains)
- Rate limiting configuration
- Security headers for middleware compatibility

### 4. Example Usage

Created `src/api/routers/auth_example.py` showing:
- Login endpoint with JWT token generation
- Protected endpoints using `Depends(require_auth)`
- User registration example

## Dependencies

Added to `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
"pyjwt>=2.10.1,<3.0.0",
"passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4,<2.0.0",
```

## Migration Notes

1. The complex `src/config/security.py` has been backed up to `src/config/security_complex_backup.py`
2. The new security service is in `src/services/security.py`
3. Existing middleware continues to work with the updated `SecurityConfig`
4. The `SecurityValidator` interface is maintained for compatibility

## Production Considerations

1. **JWT Secret**: Set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable in production
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider using Redis instead of in-memory storage
3. **User Storage**: Replace the example in-memory user store with a proper database
4. **API Keys**: Implement proper API key management if needed
5. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production (handled by reverse proxy)

## Total Lines of Code

- **Before**: 969 lines (complex security.py)
- **After**: 290 lines (simplified security.py)
- **Reduction**: 70% fewer lines of code
