## Conclusion

While the test foundation is solid with excellent patterns in the covered areas, significant gaps exist in critical agentic functionality. The **AgenticOrchestrator** shows exemplary testing with 93% coverage, demonstrating the project's testing capability. However, **DynamicToolDiscovery** (25%) and **QueryOrchestrator** (14%) require immediate attention as they contain core autonomous decision-making logic.

**Priority Order:**
1. **Immediate**: Fix MCP service import issues and test QueryOrchestrator
2. **Critical**: Complete DynamicToolDiscovery coverage
3. **Important**: Add integration and coordination module tests
4. **Enhancement**: Implement performance and stress testing

The project shows strong testing discipline where coverage exists, indicating that achieving 90%+ coverage is highly achievable with focused effort on the identified gaps.
