3. **Error Handling Modernization** (Days 5-7): Browser-use uses FastAPI HTTPException patterns
4. **Service Layer Simplification** (Week 2): Browser-use implements function-based patterns (no service classes)
5. **Circuit Breaker Implementation** (Days 5-7 Week 2): Browser-use uses same enterprise resilience patterns
