# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Multi-Collection Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop an enterprise-grade federated multi-collection vector architecture with Redis 8 Vector Sets integration, advanced query routing, and cloud-native scalability.
# Details:
1. Integrate Redis 8 Vector Sets as the core vector storage engine, leveraging int8 quantization for memory and speed optimization (75% memory reduction, 30% speed improvement).
2. Implement federated search architecture with distributed query routing across multiple vector databases, supporting intelligent load balancing and regional optimization.
3. Build advanced collection orchestration with multi-tenant isolation, enterprise RBAC, and SOC 2 Type II audit trails.
4. Enable real-time collection synchronization using event-driven architecture (Kafka/Redis Streams) for zero-downtime updates and cross-datacenter replication.
5. Develop AI-powered query optimization using machine learning to route queries based on collection metadata, user context, and historical performance.
6. Integrate enterprise observability with OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing, custom business metrics, and predictive alerting.
7. Achieve cloud-native scalability with Kubernetes StatefulSets, auto-scaling for vector workloads, and GitOps deployment.
8. Ensure security and compliance: zero-trust JWT authentication, fine-grained RBAC, collection-level encryption, GDPR/CCPA compliance, and automated data lifecycle management.
9. Seamlessly integrate with Task 19 (Redis 8 Vector Sets), Task 20 (Advanced Observability), and Task 18 (Enterprise SSO) for unified enterprise architecture.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit and integration tests for Redis 8 Vector Sets integration and int8 quantization correctness.
2. Distributed system tests for federated search, query routing, and regional optimization.
3. Security and compliance tests: JWT authentication, RBAC enforcement, encryption, and audit trail validation.
4. Performance tests: sub-50ms cross-collection search latency (95th percentile), 10x indexing throughput, and 99.99% availability under load.
5. Real-time synchronization tests: zero-downtime updates and cross-datacenter replication.
6. Observability and alerting validation with OpenTelemetry and custom metrics.
7. Scalability tests: support for 1B+ vectors across 1000+ collections with linear scaling.
8. Integration tests with Tasks 18, 19, and 20 for end-to-end enterprise workflows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Multi-Collection Vector Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the vector database schema to support multiple collections using Redis 8 Vector Sets, ensuring efficient indexing, int8 quantization, metadata tagging, and compatibility with async Python patterns.
### Details:
Define collection abstractions, metadata models, and indexing strategies using Pydantic v2 models. Integrate Redis 8 Vector Sets with int8 quantization for memory and speed optimization. Leverage async database drivers and dependency injection for scalable schema management. Ensure schema supports multi-tenant isolation, RBAC, audit trails, and future expansion with hardware acceleration.

## 2. Develop Cross-Collection Search Algorithms and Query Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement async federated cross-collection search algorithms with intelligent, ML-driven query routing based on collection metadata, user context, and historical performance.
### Details:
Use FastAPI async endpoints to orchestrate vector search across federated collections and multiple vector databases. Integrate AI/ML-based query routing for optimal relevance, load balancing, and regional optimization. Ensure sub-50ms latency for typical queries and support for distributed query execution.

## 3. Build Collection Management API with CRUD, Configuration, and Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop a FastAPI-based API for collection lifecycle management, including CRUD operations, collection-specific configuration, multi-tenant isolation, RBAC, and audit trails.
### Details:
Expose endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and configuring collections. Use Pydantic v2 for request/response validation. Enforce enterprise RBAC, JWT authentication, input validation, and SOC 2 Type II audit trails for security and compliance.

## 4. Integrate Observability, Monitoring, and AI/ML Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Implement OpenTelemetry-based observability, real-time monitoring, distributed tracing, custom business metrics, and predictive alerting for federated search and collection management.
### Details:
Instrument all async endpoints and database operations with OpenTelemetry. Provide dashboards for query performance, error rates, collection usage, and predictive alerting. Integrate AI/ML analytics for usage patterns, anomaly detection, and business metrics. Ensure seamless integration with Task 20 (Advanced Observability).

## 5. Automate Production Deployment, Performance Optimization, and Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Automate deployment with CI/CD, optimize for sub-50ms latency and 99.99% uptime, and enforce comprehensive quality assurance including property-based and mutation testing. Achieve cloud-native scalability with Kubernetes StatefulSets, auto-scaling, and GitOps deployment.
### Details:
Use containerized deployment with Kubernetes StatefulSets, auto-scaling, rolling updates, and configuration automation. Continuously profile and optimize resource utilization for vector workloads. Integrate property-based and mutation testing in CI/CD pipelines. Ensure GitOps-based deployment and zero-downtime collection migrations.
