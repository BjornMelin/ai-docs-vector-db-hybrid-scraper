Enforce security-first practices (e.g., encryption, secrets management, access controls) and monitor for configuration drift.\n<info added on 2025-06-24T20:04:45.895Z>\nCRITICAL PIVOT: After discovering significant overlap with completed Task 20 \"Advanced Observability & AI Monitoring\", this subtask must be refactored to avoid duplication. Task 20 already implemented configuration-specific OpenTelemetry instrumentation, performance monitoring, and config integration. Instead of rebuilding existing functionality, focus on: 1) Integration - Connect existing Task 20 observability system with configuration modules that weren't previously instrumented, 2) Enhancement - Identify and implement any missing observability features in the existing codebase rather than creating parallel implementations, 3) Testing - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for the existing observability infrastructure in src/services/observability/, 4) CI/CD Integration - Implement automated deployment and validation pipelines specifically for the observability components that weren't addressed in Task 20. This approach leverages existing work while avoiding technical debt from duplicate implementations.\n</info added on 2025-06-24T20:04:45.895Z>",
