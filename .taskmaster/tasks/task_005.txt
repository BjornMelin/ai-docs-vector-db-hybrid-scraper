# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement enterprise-grade, production-resilient circuit breaker patterns for all external dependencies to maximize system reliability and minimize failure propagation.
# Details:
1. Use modern circuit breaker libraries (tenacity, circuitbreaker) with Python 3.13+ async support and FastAPI 0.115.12 dependency injection patterns.
2. Implement hierarchical circuit breakers: service-level, endpoint-level, and feature-level with Redis 8 Vector Sets for state persistence.
3. Apply circuit breakers to all external services: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, Qdrant vector database, Redis 8 caching, PostgreSQL/Supabase databases.
4. Configure intelligent, ML-powered failure thresholds using historical metrics, SLA requirements, and predictive analytics for adaptive thresholds.
5. Integrate comprehensive health checks with OpenTelemetry observability for automatic circuit state management and self-healing capabilities.
6. Export detailed OpenTelemetry metrics (circuit state, failure rates, recovery times) with custom semantic conventions for AI/ML operations.
7. Build real-time Grafana dashboards with predictive alerting, automated incident response, and integration with PagerDuty/Slack for circuit breaker events.
8. Implement advanced graceful degradation strategies: cached responses, simplified feature modes, and intelligent fallback service routing.
9. Integrate with Kubernetes service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for traffic shaping, canary deployments, and automated failover orchestration.
10. Apply Netflix Hystrix patterns, Google SRE error budgets, chaos engineering with Litmus/Chaos Monkey, and 2025 observability best practices.
11. Target 99.9% uptime SLA, 50% reduction in failure propagation, 70% improvement in recovery times, and sub-100ms circuit breaker decision latency.
12. Implement security-conscious circuit breakers with rate limiting, DDoS protection, and authentication failure circuit patterns for zero-trust architecture.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test circuit breaker logic using pytest 8.x+ with async fixtures for all states (Closed, Open, Half-Open) and hierarchical levels.
2. Integration test with testcontainers and mock external services (OpenAI/Anthropic, Qdrant, Redis 8, PostgreSQL) using contract testing with Pact.
3. Chaos engineering tests with Litmus/Chaos Monkey to simulate failure scenarios, validate 99.9% uptime SLA and 50% reduction in failure propagation.
4. Performance testing with pytest-benchmark to verify 70% improvement in recovery times and sub-100ms circuit breaker decision latency.
5. Property-based testing with Hypothesis for circuit breaker state transitions and edge case discovery.
6. Mutation testing with mutmut to validate test quality and resilience patterns.
7. Validate OpenTelemetry metrics collection, Grafana dashboard integration, and predictive alerting workflows.
8. Security testing for rate limiting, DDoS protection, and authentication failure circuit patterns in zero-trust scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Circuit Breaker Architecture and Service Mapping [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Map all external dependencies (OpenAI, Qdrant, Redis, databases) and define multi-level circuit breaker scopes (per-service, per-endpoint). Establish dependency injection patterns and async integration points using FastAPI and Pydantic v2.
### Details:
Document all critical service interactions and their failure domains. Specify where circuit breakers should be applied and how they will be injected into the service layer. Ensure the design supports async, non-blocking operations and is compatible with modern Python frameworks.

## 2. Implement Configurable, Async Circuit Breakers with Fallbacks [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Integrate modern circuit breaker libraries (e.g., py-breaker, circuitbreaker) with async support. Implement robust fallback strategies and graceful degradation for each external dependency.
### Details:
Develop reusable, function-based circuit breaker components with service-specific configuration for thresholds, timeouts, and recovery. Ensure fallback logic is in place for each critical path, supporting static responses, cached data, or alternate services as appropriate.

## 3. Configure Intelligent Thresholds, Recovery, and Self-Healing [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Analyze historical metrics and SLAs to set intelligent, service-specific failure thresholds, timeout periods, and recovery strategies. Integrate health checks for automatic circuit state management and self-healing.
### Details:
Use real-world data and best practices to configure thresholds. Implement health check endpoints and background recovery tasks that automatically reset circuit states based on dependency health.

## 4. Integrate Observability, Monitoring, and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Instrument circuit breaker components with OpenTelemetry for detailed metrics collection. Export metrics to Prometheus and visualize circuit breaker states and events in Grafana dashboards.
### Details:
Ensure all circuit breaker state changes, failures, and recoveries are logged and exported. Configure real-time alerts for critical circuit breaker events. Provide dashboards for operational visibility and SLA tracking.

## 5. Validate Production Readiness and Resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Conduct chaos engineering experiments and load testing to validate circuit breaker effectiveness, graceful degradation, and recovery. Ensure compliance with enterprise architecture, security, and deployment automation standards.
### Details:
Simulate real-world failure scenarios and high-load conditions. Validate that the system meets 99.9% uptime, reduces failure propagation by 40%, and improves recovery times by 60%. Review deployment, security, and maintainability against enterprise standards.

## 6. Parallel Integration with Service Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Ensure circuit breaker implementation can proceed in parallel with service layer refactoring by establishing clear integration points and interfaces.
### Details:
Define stable interfaces and integration points that allow circuit breaker development to proceed independently of service layer changes. Document how circuit breakers will be integrated into both existing and refactored service components.
