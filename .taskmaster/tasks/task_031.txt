# Task ID: 31
# Title: FastMCP 2.0 server optimisation - Refactor MCP tools to FastMCP 2.x, adding caching, progress reporting, and sub-100 ms latency target
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 21, 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Upgrade MCP server implementation to FastMCP 2.x framework with advanced caching, real-time progress reporting, and performance optimizations to achieve sub-100ms response latency for all MCP operations.
# Details:
1. Upgrade FastMCP dependency to version 2.x:
   - Update pyproject.toml to require fastmcp>=2.0.0
   - Review FastMCP 2.x breaking changes and migration guide
   - Ensure compatibility with existing MCP tool implementations

2. Implement FastMCP 2.x server architecture:
   - Refactor existing MCP server code to use FastMCP 2.x patterns and APIs
   - Leverage new async/await improvements and connection pooling features
   - Implement proper resource management and lifecycle handling
   - Configure optimized server settings for high-throughput operations

3. Add intelligent caching layer:
   - Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed MCP operations
   - Add cache invalidation strategies based on data freshness requirements
   - Configure cache TTL values optimized for different operation types
   - Implement cache warming for predictable operations

4. Integrate real-time progress reporting:
   - Add progress callbacks for long-running MCP operations (embedding generation, document processing)
   - Implement WebSocket-based progress streaming to clients
   - Add operation cancellation support for improved user experience
   - Configure progress granularity based on operation complexity

5. Performance optimization for sub-100ms latency:
   - Implement connection pooling and keep-alive strategies
   - Add request batching for bulk operations
   - Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization using orjson
   - Configure async task queuing for non-blocking operations
   - Add performance monitoring and alerting for latency thresholds

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance benchmarking validation:
   - Create comprehensive MCP operation benchmark suite measuring latency, throughput, and resource usage
   - Execute before/after performance tests to verify sub-100ms latency target
   - Test with various payload sizes and concurrent connection scenarios
   - Validate cache hit rates and performance improvements

2. Functional testing:
   - Verify all existing MCP operations work correctly after FastMCP 2.x migration
   - Test progress reporting accuracy and real-time updates
   - Validate cache consistency and invalidation strategies
   - Test operation cancellation and error handling

3. Load testing:
   - Execute stress tests with high concurrent MCP requests
   - Validate server stability under sustained load
   - Test cache performance under high-frequency operations
   - Measure memory usage and connection handling efficiency

4. Integration testing:
   - Test MCP server integration with existing FastAPI application
   - Validate compatibility with current MCP client implementations
   - Test end-to-end workflows including caching and progress reporting

# Subtasks:
## 1. Upgrade FastMCP Dependency and Ensure Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the MCP server's dependencies to require FastMCP 2.x, review breaking changes and migration guides, and ensure all existing MCP tool implementations are compatible with the new version.
### Details:
Modify pyproject.toml to require fastmcp>=2.0.0. Review FastMCP 2.x documentation for breaking changes and migration steps. Test existing MCP tools for compatibility and refactor as needed.

## 2. Refactor MCP Server to FastMCP 2.x Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Refactor the MCP server codebase to adopt FastMCP 2.x patterns, including async/await improvements, connection pooling, and optimized server settings for high-throughput operations.
### Details:
Update server initialization and tool/resource registration to use FastMCP 2.x APIs. Implement async/await where appropriate. Configure server settings for optimal performance and resource management.

## 3. Implement Intelligent Caching Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Add a Redis-based caching layer for frequently accessed MCP operations, including cache invalidation, TTL configuration, and cache warming for predictable operations.
### Details:
Integrate Redis with the MCP server. Implement caching decorators or middleware for selected operations. Define cache invalidation and TTL strategies based on data freshness. Pre-warm cache for common queries.

## 4. Integrate Real-Time Progress Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Add real-time progress reporting for long-running MCP operations using WebSocket-based streaming, progress callbacks, and operation cancellation support.
### Details:
Implement progress callbacks in long-running tools. Set up WebSocket endpoints for streaming progress updates to clients. Add support for operation cancellation and configure progress granularity.

## 5. Optimize Performance for Sub-100ms Latency [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.3, 31.4
### Description: Apply advanced performance optimizations, including connection pooling, request batching, optimized JSON serialization, async task queuing, and latency monitoring to achieve sub-100ms response times.
### Details:
Enable connection pooling and keep-alive. Implement request batching for bulk operations. Switch to orjson for fast serialization. Use async task queues for non-blocking execution. Set up monitoring and alerting for latency thresholds.
