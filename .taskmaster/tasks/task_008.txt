# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Search Analytics Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Showcase a full-stack, real-time analytics dashboard for search query patterns, system performance, user behavior, and business intelligence insights, leveraging modern observability and analytics architecture.
# Details:
This task demonstrates end-to-end product analytics and observability expertise, combining backend instrumentation, efficient data aggregation, and advanced frontend visualization:

1. Instrument real-time metrics collection using OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and custom business metrics.
2. Store time-series analytics in Prometheus for scalable, queryable metrics.
3. Implement event-driven, non-blocking analytics collection with efficient sliding window aggregation algorithms.
4. Integrate user behavior analytics with a privacy-first approach, following GA4 event modeling and privacy-compliant patterns.
5. Develop a FastAPI backend with endpoints for streaming analytics data and exporting business reports.
6. Enable real-time dashboard updates via WebSocket connections for live data feeds.
7. Build an interactive React dashboard using D3.js and modern visualization libraries, following Grafana dashboard best practices for accessibility, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility[1][2][3].
8. Visualize query patterns (most common searches, trending topics), performance metrics (latency, QPS), user behavior (search success, result interactions), system health (vector DB, cache hit rates), and search quality (relevance, satisfaction).
9. Integrate an A/B testing framework for feature optimization and continuous improvement.
10. Provide performance optimization insights, automated alerting for degradation, and capacity planning analytics.
11. Support export capabilities for business reporting and correlation analysis between user behavior and system performance.

This dashboard serves as a portfolio centerpiece, demonstrating:
- Full-stack product development lifecycle
- Data analytics and visualization expertise
- Business intelligence feature implementation
- Backend optimization and frontend user experience integration

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test OpenTelemetry instrumentation, data aggregation, and analytics export modules
2. Integration test the analytics pipeline from event collection to dashboard visualization
3. Performance test to ensure non-blocking analytics and minimal impact on core search functionality
4. User acceptance testing of the dashboard interface for interactivity, accessibility, and responsiveness
5. Validate privacy compliance and data export accuracy
6. Test automated alerting and SLO/SLI tracking for observability

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Real-Time Metrics Collection and Observability [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Instrument the backend using OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, custom business metrics, and system health monitoring. Ensure all critical events and performance indicators are captured in real time, following enterprise observability standards.
### Details:
Leverage FastAPI with async patterns and dependency injection to ensure non-blocking, scalable metrics collection. Integrate with Prometheus for time-series storage and enable automated alerting for performance degradation. Ensure all observability code is modular and maintainable.

## 2. Develop Event-Driven Analytics Aggregation and Storage Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement an event-driven, non-blocking analytics pipeline using efficient sliding window aggregation algorithms. Store analytics data in a scalable, queryable time-series database (e.g., Prometheus or OpenSearch).
### Details:
Ensure the aggregation layer supports high-throughput ingestion and real-time querying. Optimize for vector database performance and efficient resource utilization. Follow clean architecture and KISS principles for maintainability.

## 3. Integrate Privacy-First User Behavior Analytics and AI/ML Insights [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Capture user behavior events using GA4-compliant, privacy-first patterns. Integrate AI/ML models for advanced analytics, such as search relevance scoring, trend detection, and satisfaction prediction.
### Details:
Ensure all user data collection is privacy-compliant and anonymized. Use modern Python async patterns for event processing. Incorporate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and other ML techniques for business intelligence insights.

## 4. Build and Test FastAPI Backend with Real-Time Streaming and Export APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop a FastAPI backend with endpoints for streaming analytics data (via WebSockets) and exporting business reports. Implement robust authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring for production readiness.
### Details:
Follow function-based patterns and dependency injection for maintainability. Ensure endpoints are optimized for low latency and high concurrency. Automate deployment and configuration using modern CI/CD pipelines.

## 5. Develop Interactive React Dashboard with Advanced Visualization and BI Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Build a responsive, accessible React dashboard using D3.js and modern visualization libraries. Visualize query patterns, system performance, user behavior, and business intelligence insights. Integrate A/B testing and automated alerting features.
### Details:
Follow Grafana dashboard best practices for usability and cross-browser compatibility. Ensure real-time updates via WebSockets and support export capabilities for business reporting. Emphasize AI/ML-driven analytics and enterprise-grade UX.
