# Task ID: 35
# Title: Establish Performance Benchmarking and Regression Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and implement a comprehensive performance benchmarking and regression testing framework to establish baseline metrics and validate all claimed performance improvements throughout the modernization process.
# Details:
1. Identify and define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and error rates relevant to the application's critical workflows and modernization goals.
2. Select or develop representative benchmark scenarios covering typical, peak, and edge-case usage patterns, including real-world data and user interactions.
3. Integrate automated performance benchmarking tools (e.g., Locust, JMeter, custom scripts) into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure repeatable and consistent measurement across builds.
4. Establish baseline performance metrics by running benchmarks on the current production and pre-modernization versions, documenting results for comparison.
5. Implement regression testing to automatically compare new builds against established baselines, flagging any degradations or improvements.
6. Ensure benchmarking methodology is consistent across iterations, and update benchmarks as application features or user expectations evolve.
7. Collaborate with development and DevOps teams to monitor, analyze, and report on performance trends, providing actionable insights for optimization.
8. Document the benchmarking process, metrics, and results in a centralized location for transparency and ongoing reference.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that all critical workflows have defined and measurable KPIs with automated benchmark coverage.
- Run initial benchmarks to establish baseline metrics and validate that results are reproducible across multiple runs.
- For each modernization release, execute regression benchmarks and confirm that any claimed performance improvements are reflected in the metrics.
- Ensure automated alerts or CI/CD pipeline failures are triggered on performance regressions.
- Review benchmark reports for accuracy, completeness, and actionable insights, and confirm documentation is up to date.
