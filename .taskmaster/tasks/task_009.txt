# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Vector Embeddings Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop an interactive 3D visualization of embedding spaces for semantic exploration
# Details:
1. Use t-SNE or UMAP for dimensionality reduction of embeddings
2. Implement a 3D visualization using Three.js or similar library
3. Create an API endpoint for fetching reduced embeddings
4. Implement interactive features like zooming, rotation, and selection
5. Add clustering analysis using algorithms like K-means or DBSCAN
6. Optimize for performance with large numbers of embeddings

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms
2. Integration test the visualization pipeline
3. Performance test with large datasets (100k+ embeddings)
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing for the visualization

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Async API for Embedding Reduction [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an async FastAPI endpoint using Pydantic v2 for input validation to accept raw embeddings, perform dimensionality reduction (t-SNE/UMAP), and return reduced vectors. Integrate dependency injection for modularity and testability.
### Details:
Leverage modern Python async patterns and dependency injection for scalability. Ensure OpenTelemetry tracing and logging are integrated for observability. Validate input/output schemas with Pydantic v2. Optimize for batch processing and sub-100ms response times.

## 2. Develop 3D Interactive Visualization Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a performant, interactive 3D visualization using Three.js (or similar) to render reduced embeddings. Implement features such as zoom, rotation, and point selection, ensuring smooth interaction with large datasets.
### Details:
Follow KISS and clean architecture principles for maintainability. Use efficient rendering techniques (instancing, LOD) to handle large embedding sets. Ensure accessibility and responsive design for enterprise use.

## 3. Integrate Clustering and Semantic Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) on reduced embeddings and expose results via the API. Enable dynamic cluster visualization and semantic exploration in the frontend.
### Details:
Utilize optimized vector database techniques for clustering at scale. Provide cluster metadata and allow users to filter/explore clusters interactively. Ensure clustering logic is modular and testable.

## 4. Establish Observability, Security, and Automated Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics, and logging across backend and frontend. Implement security best practices (rate limiting, input sanitization, RBAC). Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code.
### Details:
Ensure enterprise-grade monitoring, alerting, and secure configuration management. Use containerization and orchestration (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for scalable deployment. Document operational runbooks.

## 5. Comprehensive QA, Benchmarking, and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Conduct property-based, mutation, and integration testing across all components. Benchmark system performance (latency, throughput, resource usage) and document architecture, API, and usage patterns for maintainability.
### Details:
Ensure 99.9% uptime and sub-100ms latency targets are met. Provide clear developer and user documentation. Establish regression test suites and continuous quality monitoring.
