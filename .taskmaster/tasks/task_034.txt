# Task ID: 34
# Title: Documentation Cleanup and Consolidation for Python 3.13 Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 23, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update README.md to reflect Python 3.13 compatibility and systematically archive or remove obsolete documentation files as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Review the PRD to identify all documentation files marked as obsolete or redundant, including those in the root directory and docs/ subdirectories.
2. Update README.md to explicitly state Python 3.13 as the minimum supported version, referencing key new features and compatibility notes relevant to users and contributors (e.g., free-threaded mode, updated build requirements, and deprecated modules) [1][2][5].
3. Remove or archive outdated documentation files, ensuring that any removed content is either migrated to the current docs/ structure or clearly referenced in an ARCHIVED_DOCS.md file for historical purposes.
4. Audit all documentation links (internal and external) in README.md and docs/ to ensure they do not reference removed or obsolete files.
5. Update any badges, version tables, or compatibility matrices to reflect Python 3.13 as the baseline.
6. Coordinate with the documentation infrastructure to ensure MkDocs navigation and search do not reference archived or deleted files.
7. Commit changes with clear messages indicating which files were updated, removed, or archived, and why, referencing the PRD for traceability.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify README.md displays Python 3.13 as the minimum supported version and accurately summarizes key compatibility notes.
- Confirm all obsolete documentation files listed in the PRD are either removed or archived, and that no broken links remain in the documentation set.
- Run MkDocs build and serve locally to ensure navigation, search, and references are correct and do not include obsolete files.
- Review the repository for any remaining references to removed documentation in scripts, CI/CD configs, or deployment guides.
- Peer review the documentation changes to ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review PRD and Identify Obsolete Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to compile a list of all documentation files marked as obsolete or redundant, including those in the root directory and docs/ subdirectories.
### Details:
Carefully cross-reference the PRD with the current documentation structure to ensure all files flagged for removal or archiving are accounted for.

## 2. Update README.md for Python 3.13 Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Revise README.md to explicitly state Python 3.13 as the minimum supported version, highlighting key new features and compatibility notes relevant to users and contributors.
### Details:
Include references to major Python 3.13 changes such as free-threaded mode, updated build requirements, and deprecated modules, ensuring clarity for both users and contributors.[1][5]

## 3. Archive or Remove Obsolete Documentation Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Systematically remove or archive documentation files identified as obsolete, migrating any necessary content to the current docs/ structure or referencing it in an ARCHIVED_DOCS.md file for historical purposes.
### Details:
Ensure that removed files are either properly archived or their content is preserved as needed, and update ARCHIVED_DOCS.md to list all archived files.

## 4. Audit and Update Documentation Links [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2, 34.3
### Description: Review all internal and external documentation links in README.md and docs/ to ensure they do not reference removed or obsolete files.
### Details:
Update or remove links as necessary to prevent broken references and maintain documentation integrity.

## 5. Update Badges, Version Tables, and Documentation Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2, 34.3, 34.4
### Description: Update any badges, version tables, or compatibility matrices to reflect Python 3.13 as the baseline, and coordinate with documentation infrastructure to ensure navigation and search do not reference archived or deleted files.
### Details:
Work with MkDocs or other documentation tools to update navigation and search indices, and ensure all visual indicators and tables are current.
