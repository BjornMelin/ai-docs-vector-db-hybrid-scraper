# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Interactive Setup Wizard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a CLI-driven configuration wizard with auto-detection and validation
# Details:
1. Implement an interactive CLI using the Rich library
2. Integrate auto-detection results into the wizard flow
3. Create step-by-step configuration process with user confirmation
4. Implement real-time configuration validation and feedback
5. Add configuration testing and verification steps
6. Implement progress tracking and error recovery

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each wizard step and validation logic
2. Conduct usability testing with different user personas
3. Integration test with various environment setups
4. Verify 95%+ setup success rate for new users

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design CLI Wizard Architecture with Async Patterns and Dependency Injection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture for the CLI-driven setup wizard using modern Python async patterns, dependency injection, and clean, function-based design. Specify how the Rich library will be integrated for interactive UX and how configuration state will be managed.
### Details:
Establish a modular, maintainable structure leveraging FastAPI-style dependency injection, async/await for non-blocking operations, and clear separation of concerns. Document the architecture, including flow diagrams and interface contracts.

## 2. Implement Auto-Detection and Real-Time Validation Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop async modules for auto-detecting system environment, dependencies, and configuration options. Integrate real-time validation using Pydantic v2 models and property-based testing for robust input handling.
### Details:
Use Pydantic v2 for schema validation and error feedback. Ensure modules are extensible for future AI/ML-driven detection. Provide clear error messages and suggestions for remediation.

## 3. Develop Interactive Step-by-Step CLI Flow with Progress Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Build the interactive CLI wizard using the Rich library, guiding users through configuration steps with real-time feedback, progress indicators, and user confirmation at each stage.
### Details:
Implement async CLI prompts, dynamic branching based on auto-detection results, and persistent progress tracking for error recovery. Ensure accessibility and usability for enterprise environments.

## 4. Integrate Observability, Security, and AI/ML Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Embed OpenTelemetry-based observability, security best practices, and optional AI/ML analytics (e.g., usage insights, anomaly detection) into the wizard flow for enterprise readiness.
### Details:
Instrument all key flows with OpenTelemetry traces and metrics. Apply secure input handling and configuration storage. Optionally, integrate AI/ML modules for advanced analytics and visualization.

## 5. Productionize: Automated Testing, Deployment, and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated testing (including mutation and property-based tests), containerized deployment, and comprehensive documentation for maintainability and portfolio value.
### Details:
Use modern CI/CD tools to automate linting, testing, and deployment. Provide Dockerfiles and deployment manifests. Write user and developer documentation following KISS and clean architecture principles.
