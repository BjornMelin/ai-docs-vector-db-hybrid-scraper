# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Showcase a cutting-edge, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system as a premier 2025 portfolio feature. Demonstrate expertise in enterprise LLM integration, advanced retrieval strategies, and generative AI safety. The implementation should highlight modern RAG patterns, robust architecture, and business impact, positioning for senior AI/ML engineering opportunities.
# Details:
1. Integrate latest LLM services (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) with intelligent fallback strategies and async, non-blocking API calls with retry logic and circuit breakers
2. Optimize context windows for token efficiency and relevance, adapting to different model types
3. Implement vector search for relevant document retrieval and integrate with existing vector search pipelines
4. Engineer prompts with few-shot learning and custom templates for different document types
5. Enable multi-turn conversation support with intent classification using fine-tuned models
6. Add source attribution with automatic citation extraction and confidence scoring using ML-based answer quality assessment
7. Stream responses using Server-Sent Events for real-time user experience and implement semantic caching with Redis 8 Vector Sets for 60-80% cost reduction
8. Integrate hallucination detection/mitigation and production safety patterns
9. Establish answer quality metrics (relevance, completeness, accuracy) and A/B testing for prompt optimization
10. Incorporate RAG evaluation frameworks (e.g., RAGAS, TruLens), advanced retrieval strategies (HyDE, ReAct), and LLM observability/monitoring
11. Build a continuous improvement framework with business impact metrics (e.g., user time-to-insight reduction, enterprise AI readiness)
12. Implement enterprise-grade security patterns for data protection and compliance

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test all RAG components, including LLM integration, vector search, and prompt engineering
2. Integration test the end-to-end RAG pipeline, including fallback and streaming logic
3. Benchmark RAG performance (latency, throughput, token efficiency) and optimize as needed
4. Evaluate source attribution accuracy, confidence scoring, and hallucination mitigation
5. Test multi-turn conversation and intent classification features
6. Validate answer quality metrics and business impact (e.g., time-to-insight reduction)
7. Use RAG evaluation frameworks (RAGAS, TruLens) for continuous assessment
8. Monitor LLM observability and production safety patterns
9. Test semantic caching efficiency and cost reduction metrics
10. Validate security patterns and compliance with enterprise standards

## 1. Design and Implement Modular RAG System Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Architect a scalable, production-ready RAG system using modern Python async patterns, dependency injection, and clean architecture principles. Ensure modularity for LLM integration, retrieval, and orchestration components, leveraging FastAPI and Pydantic v2 for robust API design.
### Details:
Define clear interfaces for LLM services, retrieval modules, and orchestration logic. Use function-based patterns and KISS principles to maximize maintainability. Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and observability from the outset.

## 2. Develop Advanced Data Ingestion and Vector Retrieval Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Build a high-throughput, real-time data ingestion pipeline that processes, cleans, normalizes, and indexes enterprise data for vector search. Optimize vector database integration for sub-100ms retrieval and seamless scaling.
### Details:
Implement ingestion from diverse sources (databases, APIs, web scraping), with transformation to embeddings and efficient storage/indexing. Use latest vector database optimization techniques and ensure compatibility with existing pipelines.

## 3. Integrate Multi-Provider LLMs with Robust Fallback and Safety Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Integrate multiple cutting-edge LLM providers (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) with async, non-blocking API calls, intelligent fallback strategies, and circuit breakers. Implement advanced prompt engineering with few-shot learning and templates, and embed hallucination detection and mitigation strategies.
### Details:
Design a provider-agnostic LLM interface with dynamic context window optimization. Engineer prompts for different document types and enable multi-turn conversation support with intent classification using fine-tuned models. Integrate ML-based answer quality assessment and automatic citation extraction.

## 4. Implement Real-Time Response Streaming, Semantic Caching, and Observability [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Enable streaming of RAG responses using Server-Sent Events for real-time user experience and implement semantic caching with Redis 8 Vector Sets for 60-80% cost reduction. Integrate comprehensive observability, monitoring, and alerting using OpenTelemetry and modern logging standards.
### Details:
Ensure sub-100ms latency and 99.9% uptime through async streaming, intelligent cache invalidation strategies, and resource-efficient deployment. Implement real-time response optimization and instrument all critical paths for metrics, traces, and logs.

## 5. Establish Continuous Evaluation, Quality Assurance, and Business Impact Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Deploy RAG evaluation frameworks (RAGAS, TruLens), define answer quality metrics (relevance, completeness, accuracy), and implement continuous improvement loops. Automate deployment, configuration, and security hardening for production readiness.
### Details:
Set up A/B testing for prompt optimization, integrate business impact metrics (e.g., user time-to-insight reduction), and ensure compliance with enterprise security standards. Implement enterprise-grade security patterns for data protection and compliance. Use property-based and mutation testing for QA.
