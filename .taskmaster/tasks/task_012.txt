# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Configuration Profiles System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create environment-specific configuration templates with one-command setup
# Details:
1. Design configuration profiles for different environments (dev, prod, etc.)
2. Implement profile selection mechanism with smart defaults
3. Create a one-command setup process using Click library
4. Implement configuration validation and testing for each profile
5. Add profile management commands (create, update, delete)
6. Use Pydantic v2 for configuration model definitions

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test profile management and validation logic
2. Integration test one-command setup process
3. Verify configuration accuracy for each environment
4. Measure and confirm setup time reduction to 2-3 minutes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Environment-Specific Configuration Models with Pydantic v2 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define robust, type-safe configuration models for each environment (dev, staging, prod, etc.) using Pydantic v2, ensuring support for environment variables, secrets, and validation.
### Details:
Leverage Pydantic v2's BaseSettings for configuration management, enabling environment variable overrides and secret management. Structure models for extensibility and clarity, following clean architecture principles and KISS. Document all configuration fields and defaults for maintainability and onboarding.

## 2. Implement Async Profile Selection and Dependency Injection [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop an async mechanism to select and inject the appropriate configuration profile at runtime, supporting smart defaults and FastAPI dependency injection patterns.
### Details:
Utilize FastAPI's dependency injection system and async patterns to provide configuration objects per request or globally as needed. Implement profile selection logic based on environment variables, CLI flags, or config files, with sensible fallbacks. Ensure thread-safety and performance using caching (e.g., lru_cache).

## 3. Develop One-Command Setup and Profile Management CLI with Click [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create a CLI tool using Click that enables one-command setup, profile creation, update, and deletion, integrating with the configuration system and supporting async operations.
### Details:
Design CLI commands for initializing environments, managing profiles, and validating configurations. Ensure the CLI is user-friendly, supports shell completion, and integrates with deployment automation. Use async Click patterns for non-blocking operations.

## 4. Integrate Configuration Validation, Observability, and Security Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive validation for each configuration profile, integrate OpenTelemetry for observability, and enforce security best practices for secrets and sensitive data.
### Details:
Add validation hooks and runtime checks for configuration integrity. Instrument configuration loading and profile switching with OpenTelemetry traces and logs. Ensure secrets are never logged or exposed, and follow enterprise security standards for configuration management.

## 5. Productionize, Test, and Document the Configuration Profiles System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Finalize the system for production use, including deployment automation, end-to-end testing, documentation, and performance optimization to meet sub-100ms latency and 99.9% uptime targets.
### Details:
Automate deployment and configuration using CI/CD pipelines. Write comprehensive documentation for developers and operators. Optimize configuration loading for minimal latency and resource usage. Ensure the system is observable, testable, and maintainable according to enterprise standards.
