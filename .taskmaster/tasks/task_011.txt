# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Service Auto-Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop intelligent service discovery for Docker, local, and cloud environments
# Details:
1. Implement Docker Compose service discovery using docker-py
2. Create local service scanning using port probing and health checks
3. Develop cloud service integration patterns for major providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
4. Implement service configuration generation based on detected environment
5. Add fallback mechanisms for manual configuration
6. Use asyncio for non-blocking service detection

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each detection mechanism
2. Integration test with various environment setups
3. Simulate different cloud environments for testing
4. Measure and verify 80% reduction in manual configuration needs

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Async Service Discovery Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a modular, async architecture for service auto-detection across Docker, local, and cloud environments using FastAPI, Pydantic v2, and dependency injection patterns.
### Details:
Establish clear interfaces for service discovery modules, leveraging Python's asyncio for non-blocking operations. Integrate OpenTelemetry hooks for observability and ensure the design supports future AI/ML analytics and vector database integration. Document architecture decisions and provide diagrams.

## 2. Implement Docker Compose Service Discovery Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop an async module for Docker Compose service discovery using docker-py, supporting label extraction, endpoint_mode handling, and health checks.
### Details:
Parse Compose files to identify services, extract metadata (labels, endpoint_mode), and probe container health. Ensure compatibility with modern Compose features (e.g., deploy, VIP/DNSRR modes). Integrate OpenTelemetry tracing and expose metrics for discovery latency and errors.

## 3. Develop Local and Cloud Service Scanning Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create async modules for local service scanning (port probing, health checks) and cloud service integration (AWS, GCP, Azure) using provider SDKs and AI-driven heuristics.
### Details:
Implement efficient port scanning and health check routines for local services. For cloud, use provider APIs to enumerate services, apply AI/ML models for anomaly detection, and support vector database-backed analytics. Ensure secure credential handling and observability.

## 4. Automate Service Configuration Generation and Fallbacks [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Build a system to auto-generate service configuration files based on detected environment, with robust fallback mechanisms for manual overrides.
### Details:
Leverage Pydantic v2 for schema validation and FastAPI for configuration APIs. Support dynamic config generation for Docker, local, and cloud services. Implement fallback logic for manual input, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

## 5. Productionize with Observability, Security, and Deployment Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Integrate OpenTelemetry for full-stack observability, enforce security best practices, and automate deployment using modern CI/CD pipelines.
### Details:
Instrument all modules with distributed tracing and metrics. Apply enterprise security standards (secrets management, RBAC, audit logging). Automate deployment with Docker and cloud-native tools, targeting 99.9% uptime and sub-100ms latency. Document operational runbooks.
