# Task ID: 33
# Title: V1 Production Readiness Validation: Docker Container Testing & Performance Regression
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 24, 43
# Priority: medium
# Description: Validate V1 deployment readiness by executing comprehensive Docker container tests and performance regression benchmarks to ensure the application meets production standards for reliability, security, and speed.
# Details:
1. Build production Docker images using multi-stage builds and lightweight base images to minimize attack surface and resource usage. 2. Integrate automated container testing using frameworks like Testcontainers or similar, ensuring dynamic configuration of host/port and proper cleanup after tests. 3. Run end-to-end and integration tests within isolated containers, covering all critical V1 workflows. 4. Perform security scanning on built images using tools such as Snyk, Anchore, or Docker Scout to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. 5. Execute performance regression tests inside containers, benchmarking key endpoints and workflows against established V1 latency and throughput targets. 6. Document and address any failures, regressions, or security issues prior to sign-off. 7. Ensure all test and benchmark results are archived and accessible for audit and future reference.

# Test Strategy:
- Build and scan Docker images, verifying no critical vulnerabilities or misconfigurations are present.
- Run automated containerized test suites, confirming all V1-critical tests pass in the containerized environment.
- Execute performance regression benchmarks, comparing results to previous V1 baselines and ensuring no degradation in latency or throughput.
- Validate that containers are cleaned up after tests and no residual resources remain.
- Review logs and reports for any errors, regressions, or security findings, and confirm all issues are resolved before marking the task complete.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Build Optimized Production Docker Images [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create production-ready Docker images using multi-stage builds and lightweight base images to minimize attack surface and resource usage.
### Details:
Leverage Docker multi-stage builds and select minimal base images (e.g., Alpine Linux) to reduce image size and dependencies. Ensure images are tailored for production deployment and follow best practices for maintainability and security.

## 2. Automate Containerized Application Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Integrate automated testing frameworks (such as Testcontainers) to execute dynamic, isolated container tests with proper configuration and cleanup.
### Details:
Set up automated test suites that dynamically configure host/port mappings and ensure containers are properly cleaned up after tests. Use CI/CD pipelines to trigger these tests on every build.

## 3. Perform Security Scanning on Docker Images [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Scan built Docker images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations using tools like Snyk, Anchore, or Docker Scout.
### Details:
Integrate security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities and configuration issues in Docker images before deployment.

## 4. Execute Performance Regression Benchmarks [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Run performance regression tests inside containers to benchmark key endpoints and workflows against established latency and throughput targets.
### Details:
Use performance testing tools to measure application response times and throughput within containerized environments, comparing results to baseline metrics.

## 5. Document, Archive, and Address Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.3, 33.4
### Description: Document all test and benchmark results, address any failures or security issues, and archive results for audit and future reference.
### Details:
Maintain comprehensive records of test outcomes, remediation actions, and performance data. Ensure all issues are resolved prior to production sign-off and results are accessible for future audits.
