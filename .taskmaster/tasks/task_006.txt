# Task ID: 6
# Title: Update Documentation and Prepare for Release
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Comprehensively update all documentation, tooling, and guides to ensure a modern, production-ready v1.0.0 release. Emphasize documentation-as-code, automated generation, and production deployment patterns.
# Details:
1. Fix all documentation inconsistencies and standardize Python version to 3.13+
2. Create comprehensive deployment guides with production examples (Docker, Kubernetes, major cloud providers)
3. Update setup scripts for cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
4. Update MCP configuration to support dynamic path resolution
5. Implement documentation-as-code using MkDocs with automated generation pipelines
6. Add comprehensive API documentation using FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI 3.1 generation and interactive Swagger UI (/docs) [1][2][3][5]
7. Include interactive examples and tutorials throughout documentation
8. Add security, compliance, and migration guides (including breaking changes)
9. Create production readiness checklist and operations runbook
10. Add troubleshooting guides and FAQ sections
11. Version bump to v1.0.0 with semantic versioning
12. Generate a CHANGELOG using the conventional commits format
13. Ensure all documentation and guides meet quality standards: 95%+ user satisfaction, <5% configuration failures, comprehensive troubleshooting coverage

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all documentation links, references, and navigation in MkDocs
2. Test deployment and setup process on Linux, macOS, and Windows, including Docker and Kubernetes workflows
3. Validate MCP configuration for dynamic path resolution across platforms
4. Confirm API documentation is accurate, complete, and interactive via FastAPI's Swagger UI and OpenAPI 3.1 schema
5. Review production readiness checklist and operations runbook for completeness
6. Conduct user acceptance testing with updated documentation, targeting 95%+ satisfaction and <5% configuration failures
7. Validate troubleshooting and FAQ coverage with new user onboarding
8. Ensure CHANGELOG is generated and follows conventional commits format
9. Confirm migration and breaking change guides are clear and actionable
