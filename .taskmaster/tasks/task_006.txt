# Task ID: 6
# Title: Update Documentation and Prepare for Release
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 38, 42
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update existing documentation infrastructure to align with recent codebase changes and prepare for a modern, production-ready v1.0.0 release. Leverage the comprehensive docs/ directory structure while ensuring all content reflects current implementation and Python 3.13+ requirements.
# Details:
1. Audit and update existing documentation to align with recent codebase changes and standardize Python version to 3.13+
2. Review and enhance existing deployment guides in docs/operators/ with production examples (Docker, Kubernetes, major cloud providers)
3. Validate and update setup scripts for cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
4. Update MCP configuration to support dynamic path resolution
5. Refine existing MkDocs configuration to strengthen documentation-as-code workflows with automated generation pipelines
6. Update API documentation to ensure it reflects current implementation, leveraging FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI 3.1 generation and interactive Swagger UI (/docs) [1][2][3][5]
7. Review and enhance interactive examples and tutorials throughout documentation
8. Update security, compliance, and migration guides to reflect recent changes (including breaking changes)
9. Review and enhance production readiness checklist and operations runbook
10. Update troubleshooting guides and FAQ sections based on recent user feedback
11. Version bump to v1.0.0 with semantic versioning
12. Generate a CHANGELOG using the conventional commits format
13. Ensure all documentation and guides meet quality standards: 95%+ user satisfaction, <5% configuration failures, comprehensive troubleshooting coverage

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all documentation links, references, and navigation in MkDocs
2. Test deployment and setup process on Linux, macOS, and Windows, including Docker and Kubernetes workflows
3. Validate MCP configuration for dynamic path resolution across platforms
4. Confirm API documentation is accurate, complete, and interactive via FastAPI's Swagger UI and OpenAPI 3.1 schema
5. Review production readiness checklist and operations runbook for completeness
6. Conduct user acceptance testing with updated documentation, targeting 95%+ satisfaction and <5% configuration failures
7. Validate troubleshooting and FAQ coverage with new user onboarding
8. Ensure CHANGELOG is generated and follows conventional commits format
9. Confirm migration and breaking change guides are clear and actionable
