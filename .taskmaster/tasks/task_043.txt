# Task ID: 43
# Title: Comprehensive Test Suite & CI Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42
# Priority: high
# Description: Reach ≥95 % coverage for browser-use modules and integrate with existing pipeline.
# Details:
1. Structure tests:
   - `tests/unit/` – pure logic (config, utils).
   - `tests/async/` – async functions with pytest-asyncio.
   - `tests/integration/` – FastAPI testclient + play-wright.
   - `tests/property/` – Hypothesis strategies.
   - `tests/perf/` – locust scripts measuring throughput.
2. Use `pytest-cov --cov=browser_use --cov-fail-under=95`.
3. Parallelize with `pytest-xdist -n auto`.
4. Add GitHub Action step `playwright install --with-deps`.
5. Upload coverage XML to Codecov.
6. Introduce contract tests for OpenAPI schema stability (`schemathesis`).
7. Generate test data via `faker` to avoid external IO.

# Test Strategy:
• CI run passes on PR.
• Coverage report shows ≥95 %.
• Failing property-based case auto-shrinks.
• Perf test: 5 agents scrape 40 pages/min in CI perf job.
• End-to-end docker-compose up → make e2e passes in <90 s.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Structure and Organize Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Organize tests into unit, async, integration, property, and performance categories.
### Details:
Create directories for each test type: `tests/unit/`, `tests/async/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/property/`, and `tests/perf/`.

## 2. Implement Test Coverage and Parallelization [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Achieve ≥95% coverage for browser-use modules and parallelize tests.
### Details:
Use `pytest-cov --cov=browser_use --cov-fail-under=95` and parallelize with `pytest-xdist -n auto`.

## 3. Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.2
### Description: Integrate tests with GitHub Actions and upload coverage reports.
### Details:
Add GitHub Action step `playwright install --with-deps` and upload coverage XML to Codecov.

## 4. Enhance Test Suite with Contract and Data Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.3
### Description: Introduce contract tests and generate test data.
### Details:
Use `schemathesis` for OpenAPI schema stability and generate test data via `faker`.
