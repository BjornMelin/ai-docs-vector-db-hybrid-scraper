# Subtasks:
## 1. Resolve Import and Registry Errors in Test and Source Modules [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix all import errors and missing registry issues in both source and test files, including TASK_REGISTRY in src/services/task_queue/tasks.py and references in test_crawl4ai_bulk_embedder.py and QueryType.CODE enum.
### Details:
Audit all failing imports and registry lookups, refactor module paths for compatibility with modern Python packaging, and ensure all enums and registries are correctly referenced. Validate fixes by running all affected tests and confirming successful imports.

MOSTLY COMPLETED: Test Infrastructure Fix subagent successfully resolved major import and registry errors. Key accomplishments: (1) Fixed TASK_REGISTRY definition in src/services/task_queue/tasks.py with proper backward compatibility alias, (2) Resolved QueryType.CODE enum references in model_selector.py and query_classifier.py, (3) Increased test collection from 3,529 to 3,808 tests. Remaining issue: task_queue config attribute missing from Config class causing worker.py test failures. This represents significant progress on test infrastructure stability.
