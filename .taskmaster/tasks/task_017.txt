3. Implement ML-powered language detection with confidence scoring, supporting mixed-language and embedded code blocks.
4. Extend semantic analysis with AST-based code intelligence, dependency graph extraction, complexity metrics, and architectural insights.
5. Integrate real-time language services (LSP) for live syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and refactoring suggestions.
6. Enable enterprise code intelligence: automated documentation generation, API discovery, codebase health scoring, and technical debt analysis.
7. Support cross-language code analysis with polyglot dependency tracking and unified metrics.
8. Enhance embedding generation and semantic search with language-aware chunking and vector indexing, optimized for Redis 8 Vector Sets.
9. Productionize with distributed, parallel, and incremental processing (Kubernetes, work-stealing queues, delta updates), and comprehensive OpenTelemetry observability.
10. Integrate with enterprise IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and analytics dashboards for real-time insights and operational excellence.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit and integration tests for Tree-sitter 0.24+ parser initialization, multi-language and multi-modal content processing, and ML-powered language detection.
2. End-to-end tests for semantic analysis, code intelligence, and documentation generation across the 2025 language support matrix.
3. Performance and scalability tests: concurrent parsing (10K+ files), incremental updates, and distributed processing benchmarks.
4. Security and compliance validation: input validation, RBAC, dependency scanning, and incident response drills.
5. Observability and analytics checks: OpenTelemetry metrics, trace coverage, and dashboard validation for language coverage and processing efficiency.
