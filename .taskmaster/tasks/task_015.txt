5. Establish production ML model serving with sub-10ms inference latency, semantic caching, and edge/cloud hybrid deployment (PyTorch 2.2, TorchServe)
6. Implement comprehensive model observability: drift detection, data quality monitoring, custom ML metrics, and automated retraining triggers (OpenTelemetry)
7. Enforce enterprise AI governance: model lineage, bias detection, explainability dashboards, regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, SOX), RBAC, and audit trails
8. Support federated learning, model encryption, and secure inference environments
9. Build A/B testing and analytics visualization framework with automated canary deployments and interactive dashboards
10. Integrate LangChain/LlamaIndex for RAG-enhanced analytics and semantic search

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit and integration test all ML components, pipelines, and async endpoints

3. Validate recommendation and anomaly detection accuracy using offline and live metrics
4. Conduct automated A/B and canary tests for model and algorithm improvements
5. Simulate streaming and concurrent workloads to verify scalability (10K+ concurrent requests, 99.9% uptime)
6. Test model drift, data quality, and retraining triggers with synthetic and real data
7. Perform security, RBAC, and audit trail validation for all ML operations
8. Validate regulatory compliance and explainability dashboards
9. UI/UX and business KPI testing for analytics dashboards and reporting
