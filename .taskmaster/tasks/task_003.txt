# Task ID: 3
# Title: Modernize Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Elevate error handling to production-grade standards using modern FastAPI patterns for 2025. Replace legacy custom exceptions with structured FastAPI HTTPException-based responses, provide actionable context and fix suggestions, and ensure observability and resilience. Integrate global error handlers, structured logging, and advanced monitoring to deliver robust, user-friendly, and traceable error management across the application.
# Details:
1. Replace custom exception hierarchy with FastAPI HTTPException, using structured detail objects for all errors[2][5].
2. Implement an APIError class extending HTTPException, including context, timestamp, and request_id for traceability.
3. Add global exception handlers for HTTPException, RequestValidationError, and generic Exception to ensure consistent error responses and logging[1][2][4].
4. Provide structured error responses with actionable user guidance and field-level feedback for validation errors[1][5].
5. Integrate error handling with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and correlation IDs.
6. Implement error rate monitoring and automated alerting via observability stack (e.g., ELK, Prometheus).
7. Apply Google SRE and FastAPI best practices for error recovery, circuit breaker integration, and graceful degradation.
8. Target a 20% improvement in error handling performance and a 60%+ reduction in debugging time through structured context.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each error handler, APIError class, and middleware for correct structure and context.
2. Integration test error handling across all API endpoints, including validation and internal errors.
3. Benchmark error handling performance to verify at least 20% improvement over legacy implementation.
4. Test logging, distributed tracing, and monitoring integration for error events and correlation IDs.
5. Simulate service failures to verify graceful degradation and circuit breaker behavior.
6. Validate actionable user guidance and field-level feedback in error responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor Legacy Exceptions to Structured HTTPException Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace all legacy and custom exception classes with FastAPI's HTTPException, ensuring all error responses use structured detail objects. Implement an APIError class extending HTTPException to include actionable context, timestamps, and request IDs for traceability.
### Details:
Audit the codebase for all custom exceptions and refactor them to use HTTPException or the new APIError class. Ensure error details are structured and provide actionable information for clients.

## 2. Implement Global Exception Handlers and Validation Error Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Define and register global exception handlers for HTTPException, RequestValidationError, and generic Exception. Ensure all errors are logged and returned in a consistent, user-friendly format with actionable guidance and field-level feedback.
### Details:
Use FastAPI's @app.exception_handler decorators to centralize error handling. Customize validation error responses to include field-level feedback and remediation tips.

## 3. Integrate Structured Logging and Observability Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Add middleware for structured logging of errors and requests, capturing context such as request IDs, user info, and error details. Integrate with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and correlation IDs.
### Details:
Implement or extend middleware to log all incoming requests and errors in a structured format. Ensure logs are compatible with observability stacks (e.g., ELK, Prometheus) and support distributed tracing.

## 4. Enable Advanced Monitoring, Alerting, and Automated Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Configure error rate monitoring, automated alerting, and circuit breaker patterns for resilience. Apply Google SRE and FastAPI best practices for graceful degradation and error recovery.
### Details:
Integrate monitoring tools to track error rates and trigger alerts on anomalies. Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms to maintain uptime and degrade gracefully under failure.

## 5. Validate Production Readiness and Optimize for Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Conduct end-to-end testing, security reviews, and performance tuning to ensure error handling meets sub-100ms latency, 99.9% uptime, and maintainability standards. Automate deployment and configuration for error handling components.
### Details:
Perform property-based and mutation testing for error handling. Review for security vulnerabilities in error exposure. Benchmark error response latency and optimize as needed. Automate deployment of error handling and observability configurations.
