# Task ID: 25
# Title: Automate security scanning with Bandit & Safety CI integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Bandit for static security analysis and Safety for dependency vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipeline with fail-on-high severity configuration and weekly scheduled runs.
# Details:
1. Configure Bandit static security analysis:
   - Add bandit to development dependencies in pyproject.toml
   - Create .bandit configuration file to exclude false positives and configure severity levels
   - Set up bandit to scan src/ directory with high severity fail threshold
   - Configure output formats (JSON, SARIF) for CI integration

2. Integrate Safety dependency vulnerability scanning:
   - Add safety to development dependencies
   - Configure safety to check against vulnerability databases
   - Set fail threshold for high/critical vulnerabilities
   - Generate reports in JSON format for CI consumption

3. Update GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:
   - Add security scanning job to existing workflow in .github/workflows/
   - Configure job to run bandit and safety checks on every PR and push
   - Set up fail conditions for high/critical severity findings
   - Add artifact collection for security reports

4. Implement weekly scheduled security scans:
   - Create separate GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled runs
   - Configure cron schedule for weekly execution
   - Set up notifications for security findings via GitHub issues or alerts
   - Generate comprehensive security reports with trending analysis

5. Security baseline and exemption management:
   - Document baseline security findings and create exemption process
   - Implement security finding suppression for accepted risks
   - Create security policy documentation for development team

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify security tool integration:
   - Test bandit execution with intentionally vulnerable code samples
   - Validate safety correctly identifies known vulnerable dependencies
   - Confirm CI pipeline fails appropriately on high severity findings
   - Test exemption and suppression mechanisms work correctly

2. CI/CD pipeline validation:
   - Execute full CI pipeline with security checks enabled
   - Verify security reports are generated and artifacts collected
   - Test that PRs are blocked when high severity issues are found
   - Validate weekly scheduled runs execute and generate reports

3. Security coverage testing:
   - Run comprehensive scan on entire codebase to establish baseline
   - Test scanning performance impact on CI build times
   - Verify security findings are actionable and not excessive false positives
   - Confirm integration with existing UV and Python 3.13 environment

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Bandit for Static Security Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Bandit as a development dependency, create a .bandit configuration file to exclude false positives and set severity thresholds, and configure Bandit to scan the src/ directory with output in JSON and SARIF formats.
### Details:
Add Bandit to pyproject.toml, create and tune .bandit config, ensure scan targets src/, and verify output formats for CI integration.

## 2. Integrate Safety for Dependency Vulnerability Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add Safety as a development dependency, configure it to check against vulnerability databases, set fail thresholds for high/critical vulnerabilities, and generate JSON reports.
### Details:
Install Safety, configure database checks, set up fail-on-high/critical, and ensure JSON report generation.

## 3. Update CI/CD Pipeline for Security Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Modify the GitHub Actions workflow to add a security scanning job that runs Bandit and Safety on every PR and push, sets fail conditions for high/critical findings, and collects security report artifacts.
### Details:
Edit .github/workflows/ to include security jobs, configure triggers, fail logic, and artifact uploads.

## 4. Implement Weekly Scheduled Security Scans [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Create a separate GitHub Actions workflow with a cron schedule for weekly security scans, set up notifications for findings, and generate comprehensive security reports with trending analysis.
### Details:
Configure scheduled workflow, notification mechanism (e.g., GitHub issues/alerts), and reporting enhancements.

## 5. Establish Security Baseline and Exemption Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Document baseline security findings, create an exemption process for accepted risks, implement suppression in tools, and draft security policy documentation for the development team.
### Details:
Record initial findings, define and document exemption workflow, configure suppression in Bandit/Safety, and write policy docs.
