# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Enterprise SSO Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform authentication and authorization into a 2025-ready, zero-trust enterprise identity fabric with advanced SSO, OAuth 2.1, and adaptive security orchestration.
# Details:
1. Implement OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 1.0 with PKCE, device authorization, and enhanced security profiles
2. Integrate with leading enterprise IdPs (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, AWS Cognito, Google Workspace, custom SAML)
3. Develop advanced RBAC and ABAC systems with dynamic, attribute-based policy evaluation
4. Implement JWT token management with JWK rotation, audience validation, and replay protection
5. Build user lifecycle APIs with SCIM 2.0 for automated provisioning, deprovisioning, and cross-provider sync
6. Enable passwordless authentication (FIDO2/WebAuthn, biometrics, hardware keys)
7. Integrate adaptive authentication (AI-powered risk, device fingerprinting, behavioral biometrics)
8. Enforce zero-trust: continuous verification, micro-segmentation, device trust, and real-time risk-based access
9. Implement multi-factor authentication, session management, and privileged access controls
10. Provide comprehensive audit logging, SIEM integration, and automated incident response
11. Ensure compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA) and support for legacy SAML 2.0 systems
12. Deploy with FastAPI async patterns, advanced rate limiting, CORS security, and security headers
13. Achieve sub-100ms authentication at global scale with edge/CDN, Redis caching, and Kubernetes-native deployment
14. Integrate OpenTelemetry for security observability and ML-powered identity analytics

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit and property-based test all authentication, authorization, and adaptive security components
2. Integration test with real and mock SSO/IdP providers (OAuth 2.1, OIDC, SAML, SCIM)
3. Security audit: protocol compliance, zero-trust enforcement, threat detection, and MFA/session controls
4. Performance test for sub-100ms authentication at scale (multi-region, edge, failover)
5. Validate audit, SIEM, and incident response workflows
6. Compliance testing for SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA
7. Penetration testing for advanced attack vectors (replay, phishing, privilege escalation, device compromise)

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Enterprise SSO Architecture and Integration Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define security, scalability, and integration requirements for SSO. Select protocols (OAuth 2.1, OpenID Connect 1.0, SAML 2.0), identify SSO providers (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, AWS Cognito, Google Workspace, custom SAML), and determine hybrid/cloud/on-premises architecture. Plan for legacy app support, user lifecycle management, and zero-trust enforcement.
### Details:
Conduct a comprehensive application inventory, document integration points, and select architectural patterns that support modern, legacy, and hybrid environments. Ensure alignment with enterprise observability, monitoring, compliance, and zero-trust standards. Plan for multi-vendor identity orchestration and automated lifecycle management.

## 2. Implement Async OAuth 2.1, OpenID Connect, and SAML Flows with FastAPI [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop secure, async authentication endpoints using FastAPI and Pydantic v2. Integrate with selected SSO/IdP providers, supporting OAuth 2.1 (with PKCE, device flow), OpenID Connect 1.0, and SAML 2.0. Implement passwordless authentication (FIDO2/WebAuthn), adaptive authentication, and advanced token management.
### Details:
Leverage modern Python async patterns and function-based design. Ensure JWT token handling, JWK rotation, audience validation, and replay protection. Integrate OpenTelemetry for tracing, and implement advanced rate limiting, CORS security, and security headers. Support multi-factor authentication and session management.

## 3. Develop Advanced RBAC, ABAC, and Zero-Trust Policy Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Implement a flexible RBAC and ABAC system with dynamic, attribute-based policy evaluation. Enforce zero-trust principles with continuous authentication, risk-based access, and micro-segmentation across all integrated applications and APIs.
### Details:
Design RBAC/ABAC models using clean architecture principles. Integrate with user provisioning APIs and ensure roles and attributes are updated on user lifecycle events. Provide admin APIs for role and policy management. Support just-in-time access, approval workflows, and privileged session monitoring.

## 4. Build Automated User Provisioning, Deprovisioning, and Lifecycle Management APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Create async APIs for user onboarding, offboarding, and updates, supporting SCIM 2.0 and JIT provisioning. Ensure seamless integration with SSO/IdP providers, RBAC/ABAC, and adaptive authentication systems.
### Details:
Implement event-driven workflows for user lifecycle events. Integrate with enterprise HR and identity systems as needed. Ensure auditability, compliance with data retention policies, and automated cross-provider synchronization.

## 5. Implement Observability, Security Monitoring, and Automated Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4
### Description: Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics, and logging across all authentication, authorization, and adaptive security flows. Implement audit logging for all critical events, SIEM integration, and automated incident response.
### Details:
Ensure logs capture authentication attempts, adaptive risk events, role/attribute changes, provisioning actions, privileged access, and security incidents. Set up alerting for anomalous activity, impossible travel, and threat detection. Provide dashboards for operational, compliance, and identity analytics reporting. Integrate with SIEM platforms (Splunk, Elastic) and enable automated remediation workflows.
