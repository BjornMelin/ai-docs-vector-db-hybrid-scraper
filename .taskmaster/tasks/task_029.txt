# Task ID: 29
# Title: Crawl4AI advanced feature integration - Upgrade to crawl4ai>=0.6 and enable LXML parsing plus memory-adaptive dispatcher for 30% scraping speed gain
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Upgrade crawl4ai dependency to version 0.6 or higher and integrate advanced features including LXML parsing engine and memory-adaptive dispatcher to achieve a 30% improvement in web scraping performance.
# Details:
1. Upgrade crawl4ai dependency in pyproject.toml:
   - Update crawl4ai requirement from current version to >=0.6.0
   - Review breaking changes in crawl4ai 0.6 release notes and update affected code
   - Ensure compatibility with existing async crawling patterns

2. Enable LXML parsing engine for improved HTML processing:
   - Configure crawl4ai to use LXML parser instead of default BeautifulSoup for faster parsing
   - Update parsing configurations in src/services/browser/ modules
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for edge cases where LXML parsing fails
   - Optimize XPath expressions and CSS selectors for LXML compatibility

3. Implement memory-adaptive dispatcher:
   - Configure crawl4ai's memory-adaptive dispatcher to dynamically adjust concurrent request limits based on available system memory
   - Set memory thresholds and scaling parameters for optimal resource utilization
   - Integrate with existing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
   - Monitor memory usage patterns and adjust dispatcher parameters accordingly

4. Update browser service integration:
   - Modify src/services/browser/browser_use_adapter.py to leverage new crawl4ai features
   - Ensure compatibility with existing crawling workflows and data extraction patterns
   - Update error handling and retry logic for new crawl4ai API changes
   - Implement performance monitoring to track the 30% speed improvement target

5. Configuration and optimization:
   - Create configuration profiles for different scraping scenarios (lightweight vs comprehensive)
   - Implement adaptive timeout settings based on content complexity
   - Configure connection pooling and keep-alive settings for optimal performance
   - Add metrics collection for scraping throughput and resource utilization

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance benchmarking validation:
   - Create comprehensive scraping benchmark suite measuring pages/second, memory usage, and parsing accuracy
   - Execute before/after performance tests across different website types and content sizes
   - Verify â‰¥30% speed improvement target is consistently achieved
   - Monitor memory consumption patterns with memory-adaptive dispatcher enabled

2. Compatibility and functionality testing:
   - Test LXML parsing accuracy against existing BeautifulSoup results on sample documents
   - Verify all existing scraping workflows continue to function correctly
   - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms for parsing failures
   - Validate data extraction accuracy and completeness with new parsing engine

3. Integration testing:
   - Test crawl4ai integration with existing browser automation workflows
   - Verify compatibility with rate limiting, retry logic, and error handling
   - Test concurrent scraping scenarios with memory-adaptive dispatcher
   - Validate integration with existing monitoring and logging infrastructure

4. Resource utilization testing:
   - Monitor CPU and memory usage under various load scenarios
   - Test memory-adaptive dispatcher behavior under memory pressure
   - Verify graceful degradation when system resources are constrained
   - Test long-running scraping sessions for memory leaks or resource accumulation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Upgrade crawl4ai Dependency to >=0.6.0 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the crawl4ai dependency in pyproject.toml to version 0.6.0 or higher. Review the 0.6.0 release notes for breaking changes, update affected code, and ensure compatibility with existing async crawling patterns.
### Details:

## 2. Integrate LXML Parsing Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Configure crawl4ai to use the LXML parser for HTML processing instead of the default parser. Update parsing configurations and implement fallback mechanisms for edge cases.
### Details:
Adjust parser settings in relevant modules, optimize XPath and CSS selectors for LXML, and ensure robust error handling for parsing failures.

## 3. Implement Memory-Adaptive Dispatcher [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Enable and configure crawl4ai's memory-adaptive dispatcher to dynamically adjust concurrent request limits based on available system memory.
### Details:
Set memory thresholds and scaling parameters, integrate with rate limiting and throttling, and monitor memory usage to optimize dispatcher settings.

## 4. Update Browser Service Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2, 29.3
### Description: Modify browser service modules to leverage new crawl4ai features, ensuring compatibility with updated APIs and workflows.
### Details:
Refactor src/services/browser/browser_use_adapter.py and related modules, update error handling and retry logic, and implement performance monitoring to track speed improvements.

## 5. Optimize Configuration and Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Create adaptive configuration profiles, tune timeout and connection settings, and add metrics collection for throughput and resource utilization.
### Details:
Develop profiles for different scraping scenarios, implement adaptive timeouts, configure connection pooling, and integrate metrics for ongoing optimization.
