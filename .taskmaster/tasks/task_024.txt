# Task ID: 24
# Title: Increase automated test coverage to ≥ 38%
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Author comprehensive unit and integration tests focusing on low-coverage modules to meet the 38% quality gate requirement and improve overall code reliability.
# Details:
1. Conduct coverage analysis to identify modules with lowest test coverage:
   - Run `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing` to generate detailed coverage report
   - Analyze coverage gaps in core modules: embeddings, vector operations, search algorithms, and API endpoints
   - Prioritize modules with <20% coverage for immediate attention

2. Implement unit tests for core business logic:
   - Create comprehensive tests for embedding generation and similarity calculations
   - Add tests for text chunking and preprocessing algorithms
   - Implement tests for vector database operations (insert, search, update, delete)
   - Add validation tests for configuration loading and environment setup

3. Develop integration tests for service interactions:
   - Test API endpoint flows with realistic data scenarios
   - Add tests for external service integrations (OpenAI, vector databases)
   - Implement end-to-end pipeline tests for document processing workflows
   - Create tests for error handling and edge cases

4. Establish testing infrastructure improvements:
   - Set up test fixtures for consistent test data
   - Implement proper mocking for external dependencies using respx
   - Add property-based testing with hypothesis for data validation
   - Configure pytest plugins for async testing and benchmarking

5. Optimize test execution and reporting:
   - Implement parallel test execution for faster CI/CD pipelines
   - Add test categorization (unit, integration, e2e) for selective running
   - Configure coverage thresholds and quality gates in pytest configuration
   - Generate comprehensive test reports with branch coverage analysis

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify coverage targets are met:
   - Run full test suite with coverage reporting to confirm ≥38% total coverage
   - Validate that critical modules achieve minimum 50% coverage
   - Ensure no regression in existing test functionality

2. Test quality validation:
   - Execute `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=38` to enforce coverage gate
   - Run tests in isolation to ensure no interdependencies
   - Validate async test patterns work correctly with pytest-asyncio
   - Confirm proper mocking of external services (API calls, database operations)

3. CI/CD integration testing:
   - Verify tests pass in GitHub Actions environment with Python 3.11-3.13
   - Confirm coverage reports are generated and uploaded correctly
   - Test parallel execution performance and reliability
   - Validate test categorization and selective execution work as expected

4. Performance and reliability testing:
   - Benchmark test execution time to ensure reasonable CI/CD build times
   - Test flaky test detection and resolution
   - Verify test data cleanup and isolation between test runs
   - Confirm comprehensive error reporting and debugging information

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Coverage Analysis and Identify Low-Coverage Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Generate a detailed code coverage report to pinpoint modules and code paths with the lowest test coverage, prioritizing those below 20% for immediate attention.
### Details:
Run `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing` to produce a comprehensive coverage report. Analyze the output to identify gaps, focusing on core modules such as embeddings, vector operations, search algorithms, and API endpoints. Document and prioritize modules with less than 20% coverage.

## 2. Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for Core Business Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Develop and author unit tests targeting the core business logic, especially in modules identified as low-coverage, to increase code reliability and coverage.
### Details:
Create tests for embedding generation, similarity calculations, text chunking, preprocessing algorithms, and vector database operations (insert, search, update, delete). Add validation tests for configuration loading and environment setup.

## 3. Develop Integration Tests for Service Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Author integration tests to validate interactions between modules and with external services, ensuring end-to-end reliability and correct error handling.
### Details:
Test API endpoint flows using realistic data, add tests for integrations with external services (e.g., OpenAI, vector databases), implement end-to-end pipeline tests for document processing, and create tests for error handling and edge cases.

## 4. Enhance Testing Infrastructure and Test Data Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Improve the testing infrastructure to support robust and maintainable tests, including fixtures, mocking, and advanced testing plugins.
### Details:
Set up reusable test fixtures for consistent data, implement mocking for external dependencies using respx, add property-based testing with hypothesis, and configure pytest plugins for async testing and benchmarking.

## 5. Optimize Test Execution, Reporting, and Quality Gates [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Streamline test execution and reporting to support rapid feedback and enforce quality standards, ensuring the 38% coverage threshold is met.
### Details:
Implement parallel test execution for faster CI/CD, categorize tests for selective running, configure coverage thresholds and quality gates in pytest, and generate comprehensive test reports with branch coverage analysis.
