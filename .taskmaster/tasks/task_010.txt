# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Natural Language Query Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a conversational query processing system with intent recognition
# Details:
1. Implement intent recognition using a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., BERT)
2. Create a classification system for query types (e.g., search, analyze, compare)
3. Develop a state machine for managing multi-turn conversations
4. Integrate with the RAG system for answer generation
5. Implement context management for follow-up queries
6. Use FastAPI WebSockets for real-time conversation handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test intent recognition and classification components
2. Integration test the entire conversational pipeline
3. Conduct user studies to improve accuracy and natural language understanding
4. Performance test under high concurrent user loads

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Intent Recognition and Query Classification Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an async, production-grade FastAPI service using Pydantic v2 for type safety, implementing intent recognition with a pre-trained transformer (e.g., BERT) and a robust query type classifier (search, analyze, compare). Integrate dependency injection for modularity and testability.
### Details:
Leverage modern async patterns and FastAPI's dependency injection to ensure scalability and maintainability. Use OpenTelemetry for tracing and monitoring. Ensure the module is extensible for future intent types and supports enterprise-grade error handling.

## 2. Develop Multi-Turn Conversation State Machine and Context Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement a clean, function-based state machine to manage multi-turn conversations, including context tracking for follow-up queries and slot filling. Ensure compatibility with async FastAPI endpoints and clean architecture principles.
### Details:
Utilize Pydantic models for state representation and context objects. Integrate OpenTelemetry for observability of conversation flows. Ensure the state machine is stateless where possible, with pluggable persistence for enterprise deployment.

## 3. Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Database Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Connect the query interface to a RAG pipeline with optimized vector database retrieval (e.g., FAISS, Qdrant), ensuring efficient, low-latency knowledge retrieval and answer generation. Support async streaming responses.
### Details:
Apply latest vector database optimization techniques for fast semantic search. Use dependency injection for RAG and DB clients. Ensure observability with OpenTelemetry spans for retrieval and generation steps.

## 4. Implement Real-Time WebSocket API with FastAPI for Conversational Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Build a robust, async WebSocket API using FastAPI for real-time conversational query handling. Ensure secure, authenticated connections and efficient resource utilization.
### Details:
Leverage FastAPI's async WebSocket support and Pydantic v2 for message validation. Integrate OpenTelemetry for real-time monitoring. Apply KISS principles for maintainability and clean separation of concerns.

## 5. Production Deployment, Observability, and Quality Assurance Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines, configure enterprise observability (OpenTelemetry, logging, metrics), and enforce security best practices. Implement comprehensive QA with property-based and mutation testing.
### Details:
Deploy using container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), automate configuration, and set up monitoring dashboards. Enforce API security (rate limiting, auth). Ensure all modules are observable and maintainable.
