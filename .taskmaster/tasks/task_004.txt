# Task ID: 4
# Title: Flatten Service Layer Architecture
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor 50+ Manager/service classes into modern, function-based service patterns using FastAPI dependency injection, inspired by Netflix and Google SRE patterns. Emphasize maintainability, performance, and reliability through domain-driven modularization, async-first design, and robust resource management.
# Details:
1. Convert 50+ Manager/service classes to function-based patterns using FastAPI 0.115.12's enhanced dependency injection with Annotated[Depends] patterns and async context managers.
2. Build upon existing domain-driven modules (browser/, cache/, content_intelligence/, core/, crawling/, embeddings/, fastapi/, hyde/, monitoring/, query_processing/, rag/, task_queue/, utilities/, vector_db/) to complete the DDD architecture.
3. Leverage the established dependency injection patterns in services/fastapi/dependencies/ while extending them to remaining Manager classes.
4. Maintain the existing async-first patterns while ensuring all remaining services follow the same principles.
5. Leverage Pydantic V2 Pipeline API with TypeAdapter caching for 80%+ performance gains in data validation and transformation.
6. Integrate advanced connection pooling and circuit breaker patterns (using circuitbreaker library) for all external service calls, ensuring graceful degradation and 99.9% uptime.
7. Implement streaming validation for large datasets using Pydantic V2 streaming APIs to optimize memory usage and processing efficiency.
8. Replace inheritance with composition and dependency injection throughout the service layer, following 2025 SOLID principles.
9. Integrate with Redis 8 Vector Sets for efficient caching and data retrieval with semantic similarity thresholds.
10. Achieve at least 60% reduction in cyclomatic complexity (measured by radon/cognitive complexity tools) while preserving 887.9% throughput improvement.
11. Implement comprehensive health checks for all service dependencies with OpenTelemetry integration and automated remediation.
12. Maintain performance benchmarks: 887.9% throughput improvement and sub-100ms P95 latency with modern async patterns and connection optimization.
13. Incorporate security-first development with zero-trust architecture, input validation, and comprehensive audit logging for SOC 2 compliance.

NOTE (2025-06-24): Current analysis shows limited progress with 9 manager files still requiring conversion, including unified_manager.py, cache/manager.py, embeddings/manager.py, and task_queue/manager.py. The 60% complexity reduction target appears overstated based on current metrics. Systematic work is needed to complete the remaining conversions and achieve the specified patterns.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each refactored service function and dependency using pytest 8.x+ with async fixtures and proper scoping.
2. Integration test service interactions using testcontainers for realistic database and Redis testing environments.
3. Measure and verify 60%+ cyclomatic complexity reduction using radon, cognitive complexity analysis, and maintainability index.
4. Performance test with pytest-benchmark ensuring no regression: maintain 887.9% throughput improvement and sub-100ms P95 latency.
5. Test advanced connection pooling, circuit breaker resilience, and async resource cleanup under load with chaos engineering.
6. Validate health checks, OpenTelemetry integration, and automated remediation for all service dependencies.
7. Contract testing with Pact for API compatibility during migration and service boundary validation.
8. Property-based testing with Hypothesis for service function invariants and edge case discovery.
9. Mutation testing with mutmut to validate test quality and refactoring safety.
10. Validate Pydantic V2 Pipeline API performance gains with comprehensive benchmarking and memory profiling.
11. Test streaming validation efficiency with large datasets using memory profiling and performance regression detection.
12. Verify Redis 8 Vector Sets integration with semantic similarity caching and performance optimization.
13. Implement before/after complexity metrics for each refactored manager to track actual progress toward the 60% complexity reduction goal.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor Service Classes to Function-Based, Async-First Patterns [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Transform all 50+ Manager/service classes into function-based, async-first service patterns using FastAPI dependency injection. Replace inheritance with composition and ensure all business logic is encapsulated in stateless, testable functions.
### Details:
Identify and refactor remaining Manager classes across all domain modules. Follow established patterns in existing refactored services. Eliminate deep class hierarchies in favor of composable, dependency-injected functions. Use FastAPI's Depends and @lru_cache for shared resources. Ensure all services are async and leverage async context managers for resource lifecycle management. Maintain interface compatibility to avoid breaking changes.

PARTIAL PROGRESS UPDATE: Service layer refactoring is incomplete. 9 manager files still require conversion, including unified_manager.py, cache/manager.py, embeddings/manager.py, and task_queue/manager.py. The 60% complexity reduction claim appears overstated based on current codebase analysis. Priority should be given to these remaining files to implement the function-based, async-first patterns specified in the requirements. Each remaining manager should be decomposed into smaller, composable async functions with proper dependency injection using FastAPI's Depends and @lru_cache decorations. Track progress systematically with before/after metrics on cyclomatic complexity.
