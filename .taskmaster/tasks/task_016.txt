# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Data Export/Import Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a modern, enterprise-grade data export/import and backup platform supporting real-time streaming, zero-downtime migrations, cloud-native disaster recovery, and advanced data governance.
# Details:
1. Implement real-time data export functionality using Apache Kafka/Pulsar streams with exactly-once semantics, supporting 1M+ events/second throughput.
2. Create import tools leveraging change data capture (CDC) with Debezium for live, zero-downtime migrations and continuous service availability.
3. Develop multi-cloud disaster recovery with cross-cloud replication (AWS/Azure/GCP), automated failover, RTO <5 minutes, and RPO <1 minute.
4. Architect immutable backup storage with WORM compliance, ransomware protection, and air-gapped backups (Veeam/Commvault style).
5. Integrate intelligent data tiering for automated lifecycle management (hot/warm/cold storage), optimizing costs and access patterns.
6. Build a federated data mesh for decentralized data ownership, domain-specific data products, and self-serve analytics.
7. Orchestrate all backup and restore operations with Kubernetes-native operators, auto-scaling, and GitOps-driven configuration.
8. Support incremental forever backups with block-level deduplication, point-in-time recovery, and cross-region replication.
9. Automate backup testing, verification, and ML-powered analytics for optimization and predictive failure detection.
10. Enforce enterprise data governance: end-to-end lineage, privacy-first design (GDPR/CCPA), real-time data quality monitoring, and regulatory compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
11. Integrate with Redis 8 Vector Sets for optimized vector data backup/restore, OpenTelemetry for observability, and native cloud provider APIs.
12. Achieve 10x faster backup/restore, 99.999% backup success, sub-minute verification, and zero data loss during migrations/disaster recovery.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit and integration test streaming export/import pipelines (Kafka/Pulsar, CDC, Debezium).
2. Simulate zero-downtime migrations and cross-cloud failover scenarios, measuring RTO/RPO.
3. Performance test with 1M+ events/sec and large datasets (1M+ documents), including Redis 8 vector data.
4. Validate backup immutability, WORM compliance, and ransomware protection.
5. Automate backup/restore verification, ML analytics, and predictive failure detection.
6. Audit data lineage, privacy, and regulatory compliance features.
7. Verify observability (OpenTelemetry), auto-scaling, and GitOps-driven configuration in Kubernetes environments.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Async Data Export/Import APIs with Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop FastAPI endpoints for exporting and importing data in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, etc.) using async patterns and Pydantic v2 for schema validation and error handling.
### Details:
Leverage FastAPI's async capabilities and Pydantic v2 for robust data validation. Ensure endpoints support streaming for large datasets and provide clear error messages for invalid data. Integrate dependency injection for modularity and testability.

## 2. Develop Incremental Backup and Restore Mechanisms with Versioning [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Implement efficient, incremental backup and restore utilities with support for data versioning and rollback, optimized for large datasets and minimal downtime.
### Details:
Utilize modern vector database optimization techniques and async I/O for high performance. Store metadata for each backup to enable version tracking and rollback. Ensure compatibility with enterprise storage solutions and cloud-native architectures.

## 3. Integrate Observability, Monitoring, and Security for Data Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Embed OpenTelemetry-based tracing, logging, and metrics for all export/import/backup/restore operations. Implement security best practices including authentication, authorization, and audit logging.
### Details:
Instrument all endpoints and background tasks with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. Enforce RBAC for sensitive operations and log all access and changes for compliance. Provide real-time dashboards for operational visibility.

## 4. Create CLI and Automation Tools for Data Migration and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Develop CLI utilities and scripts for triggering export, import, backup, and restore operations, supporting parallel processing and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
### Details:
Build CLI tools using Typer or similar frameworks, supporting async execution and progress reporting. Ensure tools can be used in automated workflows and handle large-scale operations efficiently.

## 5. Ensure Production Readiness: Deployment, Documentation, and Maintainability [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Package all tools and APIs for production deployment with clear documentation, configuration automation, and maintainability in mind. Follow clean architecture and KISS principles.
### Details:
Automate deployment using containerization and infrastructure-as-code. Provide comprehensive documentation for APIs, CLI, and operational procedures. Refactor codebase for modularity and long-term maintainability.

## 6. Implement Real-Time Streaming Export/Import and CDC-Based Migration [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Integrate Apache Kafka/Pulsar for real-time data streaming exports/imports with exactly-once semantics. Implement change data capture (CDC) using Debezium for zero-downtime, live database migrations.
### Details:
Design and deploy streaming pipelines capable of 1M+ events/sec throughput. Ensure CDC-based migration supports continuous service availability and transactional consistency. Provide monitoring and error recovery for streaming operations.

## 7. Develop Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery and Immutable Backup Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Build cross-cloud replication (AWS/Azure/GCP) with automated failover, immutable WORM-compliant storage, ransomware protection, and air-gapped backup strategies.
### Details:
Implement backup orchestration with Kubernetes operators and native cloud provider APIs. Enforce RTO <5 minutes, RPO <1 minute. Integrate automated backup verification, regular restore testing, and ML-powered analytics for optimization.

## 8. Integrate Enterprise Data Governance, Lineage, and Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Implement end-to-end data lineage tracking, privacy-first design (GDPR/CCPA), real-time data quality monitoring, and regulatory compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) for all backup and migration operations.
### Details:
Automate PII detection, encryption, and retention policies. Provide audit trails and impact analysis for all data movements. Integrate compliance checks into backup and restore workflows.
