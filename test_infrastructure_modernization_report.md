## Technical Accomplishments

### Infrastructure Fixes
- **Config Architecture**: Added TaskQueueConfig class to resolve missing task_queue attribute
- **Import Structure**: Fixed relative import issues in test files
- **Model Validation**: Corrected SearchResult model validation errors
- **Test Compatibility**: Updated test mocks to match current model structure

### Modern Testing Patterns Demonstrated

#### 1. Async Testing with pytest-asyncio
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="function")
async def test_async_service_initialization(self, mock_service):
    assert not mock_service._initialized
    await mock_service.initialize()
    assert mock_service._initialized
```

#### 2. Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis
```python
@pytest.mark.hypothesis
@given(
    chunk_size=st.integers(min_value=100, max_value=3000),
    chunk_overlap=st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=500)
)
def test_chunking_config_properties(self, chunk_size: int, chunk_overlap: int):
    # Property-based validation with automatic edge case generation
```

#### 3. Modern Fixture Patterns
```python
@pytest_asyncio.fixture(scope="function")
async def mock_service(self, mock_config: Config):
    # Dependency injection with proper async lifecycle management
```

#### 4. Error Handling and Timeout Patterns
```python
async def test_timeout_handling(self, mock_service):
    with pytest.raises(asyncio.TimeoutError):
        await asyncio.wait_for(
            mock_service.search("test", "collection", 5),
            timeout=0.1
        )
```

## Dependencies Added
```toml
[dev]
"pytest-xdist>=3.5.0,<4.0.0",  # Parallel test execution
"hypothesis>=6.133.0,<7.0.0",   # Property-based testing
"mutmut>=2.5.1,<3.0.0",        # Mutation testing
```

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. **Focus on High-Value Files**: Prioritize testing for core business logic files
2. **Implement Mutation Testing**: Use mutmut to verify test quality
3. **Expand Async Coverage**: More async service testing patterns
4. **Property-Based Testing**: Add more Hypothesis tests for critical algorithms

### Long-Term Strategy
1. **Maintain 90%+ Coverage**: On critical business logic modules
2. **Performance Testing**: Integrate benchmark tests with CI/CD
3. **Integration Testing**: Expand E2E test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Test-driven documentation examples

## Quality Metrics

### Test Execution
- **Total Tests**: 3,977 (up from 3,808)
- **Success Rate**: 100% for modernized test suites
