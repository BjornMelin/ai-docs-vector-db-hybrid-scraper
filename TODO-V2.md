## Implementation Notes

### V2 Philosophy

- **Stability First**: V1 must be rock-solid before adding V2 features
- **User-Driven**: Prioritize features based on user feedback
- **Performance**: Every V2 feature must maintain or improve performance
- **Backward Compatibility**: V2 features should not break V1 workflows

### Success Metrics for V2

- **Feature Adoption**: >50% of users using at least one V2 feature
- **Performance**: No regression in core metrics
- **Reliability**: <0.1% error rate for V2 features
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating for V2 features

_This roadmap will be updated based on user feedback and technological advances._
