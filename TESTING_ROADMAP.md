## ðŸ“Š ESTIMATED TOTALS

- **Estimated effort**: 25-35 hours of focused work
- **Expected coverage target**: â‰¥90% for all service modules

## ðŸ§ª TESTING STRATEGY

### Approach

1. **Start with foundation** - base.py, errors.py, logging_config.py
2. **Build up dependencies** - vector_db â†’ embeddings â†’ cache â†’ crawling
3. **Add specialized services** - browser, hyde, utilities, core
4. **Finish with deployment** - ab_testing, blue_green, canary

### Testing Patterns

- **Mock external dependencies** (Qdrant, OpenAI, Redis, etc.)
- **Use pytest-asyncio** for async service testing
- **Comprehensive error scenarios** including network failures
- **Configuration validation** with various parameter combinations
- **Performance testing** where applicable (rate limits, timeouts)
- **Integration scenarios** between services

### Quality Gates

- âœ… All tests must pass before moving to next module
- âœ… â‰¥90% test coverage target for each module
- âœ… Proper linting with ruff (check + format)
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling validation
- âœ… Documentation of complex test scenarios

## ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS

1. **Remove existing services test directory** (already done)
2. **Start with Priority 1 foundation services**
3. **Work through priorities systematically**
4. **Update TEST_CLEANUP.md as progress is made**
5. **Commit progress regularly with detailed messages**

The services module testing represents the largest remaining effort but will provide comprehensive validation of the entire system's core functionality.
