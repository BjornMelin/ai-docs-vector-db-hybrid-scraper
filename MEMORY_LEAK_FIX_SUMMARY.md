# Memory Leak Fix Summary

## Applied LRU Cache Implementation to Prevent Memory Leaks

### Files Modified

1. **src/services/vector_db/filters/composer.py**
   - Added `from cachetools import LRUCache` import
   - Replaced unbounded dict cache `self.execution_cache = {}` with `LRUCache(maxsize=max_cache_size)`
   - Added `max_cache_size` parameter to `__init__` method (default: 1000)
   - Added cache management methods:
     - `get_cache_stats()` - Returns cache statistics
     - `clear_execution_cache()` - Clears the cache and logs the action
     - `cleanup()` - Comprehensive cleanup method

2. **src/services/vector_db/filters/similarity.py**
   - Added `from cachetools import LRUCache` import
   - Added `timezone` import for proper datetime handling
   - Replaced unbounded dict cache `self.clustering_cache = {}` with `LRUCache(maxsize=max_cache_size)`
   - Added `max_cache_size` parameter to `__init__` method (default: 1000)
   - Added cache management methods:
     - `get_cache_stats()` - Returns cache statistics
     - `clear_clustering_cache()` - Clears the cache and logs the action
     - `cleanup()` - Comprehensive cleanup method with history trimming
   - Fixed datetime usage to use timezone-aware datetime objects

### Key Benefits

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Caches now have a maximum size limit, preventing unbounded growth
2. **LRU Eviction**: Least Recently Used items are automatically evicted when cache is full
3. **Observable**: Cache statistics can be monitored via `get_cache_stats()`
4. **Manageable**: Caches can be manually cleared with dedicated methods
5. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: `cleanup()` methods provide proper resource management

### Implementation Pattern

```python
# Before (unbounded cache - memory leak risk)
self.cache = {}

# After (bounded LRU cache)
from cachetools import LRUCache
self.cache = LRUCache(maxsize=max_cache_size)
```

### Additional Files with Potential Memory Leaks

The following files were identified as having unbounded caches but were not modified in this fix:
- src/services/query_processing/clustering.py
- src/services/query_processing/expansion.py
- src/services/query_processing/federated.py
- src/services/utilities/hnsw_optimizer.py
- src/services/core/project_storage.py

These files should be reviewed and updated with the same LRU cache pattern if needed.
