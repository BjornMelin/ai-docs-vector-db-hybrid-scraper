  run: |
    uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=90
    
- name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
```

### Coverage Monitoring
- Set up coverage trending in CI/CD
- Alert on coverage drops > 5%
- Require 90%+ coverage for production releases

## Conclusion

The test infrastructure is well-architected with modern patterns, but significant work is needed to achieve enterprise-grade 90%+ coverage. The AgenticOrchestrator component demonstrates the quality achievable, while other components require substantial test development.

**Priority Actions:**
1. 🔥 Fix QueryOrchestrator coverage (48.61% → 85%+)
2. 🔥 Complete DynamicToolDiscovery test suite (25.41% → 80%+)  
3. 🔥 Enhance MCP Services testing (28.66% → 90%+)
4. 📈 Focus on business logic over line coverage
5. 🔗 Add comprehensive integration testing

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for critical component recovery, 4-6 weeks for complete enterprise-grade coverage.

The foundation is solid - execution of the recommended test development will achieve the 90%+ meaningful coverage target.
