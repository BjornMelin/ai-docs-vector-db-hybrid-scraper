## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Introduced `.github/dependabot.yml` to automate weekly updates for GitHub Actions and Python dependencies.
- Documented CI branch-protection guidance and pinned action examples across developer and security guides.

### Changed
- Replaced all GitHub Actions references with immutable commit SHAs (including first-party actions) and pinned `setup-uv` to version `0.8.19` for deterministic builds.
- Refactored the CI workflow to use a fan-in `ci-gate` job, ensuring branch protection relies on a single aggregated status and enforcing an 80% coverage threshold consistently.
- Tuned `tests/ci/performance_reporter.py` for precise psutil sampling, UTC timestamps, and Ruff-compliant patterns while reducing per-test overhead.
- Hardened container security scans by pinning Trivy/Hadolint actions, fixing Dockerfile selection, and locking the Trivy CLI version.

### Security
- Applied SHA pinning across composite actions and documentation snippets, aligning with GitHubâ€™s secure-use guidance to mitigate supply-chain risk.
