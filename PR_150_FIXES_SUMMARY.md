# PR #150 Code Quality Issues - Fixed

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Direct Access to Private Attributes (_config_backups)
**Issue**: The `config.py` file was directly accessing the private `_config_backups` attribute.

**Fix**: Added a public method `get_config_backups()` to the `ConfigReloader` class in `reload.py` that properly exposes backup information. Updated `config.py` to use this public method instead of accessing the private attribute.

### 2. Placeholder Fernet Key
**Issue**: The security module was generating a new Fernet key every time instead of properly deriving it from a master password, making it impossible to decrypt existing data.

**Fix**: Implemented proper key management in `security.py`:
- Derives encryption keys using PBKDF2 with a master password from environment variable `CONFIG_MASTER_PASSWORD`
- Stores key metadata (salt, iterations) to recreate keys from the master password
- Properly handles key loading to decrypt existing configurations
- Warns if no master password is set and generates a random one for development

### 3. Unused Inner Functions
**Issue**: The `startup_config` and `shutdown_config` functions appeared to be unused.

**Fix**: These functions are actually used as decorators for FastAPI event handlers (`@self.app.on_event("startup")` and `@self.app.on_event("shutdown")`). They are not unused - this was a false positive.

### 4. Type Annotation Error
**Issue**: Using lowercase `any` instead of `Any` from the typing module.

**Fix**: 
- Added `Any` import to the typing imports in `lifecycle.py`
- Changed `Dict[str, any]` to `Dict[str, Any]` in the return type annotation

### 5. Merge Conflicts Resolution
**Additional work**: Resolved numerous merge conflicts across all files:
- `config.py`: Cleaned up type annotations
- `lifecycle.py`: Resolved conflicting logger calls and type annotations  
- `reload.py`: Fixed corrupted signal handler setup code
- `security.py`: Complete rewrite to resolve extensive merge conflicts

## Remaining Linter Warnings (Non-Critical)
The remaining warnings from ruff are mostly style suggestions:
- TRY300: Consider moving return statements to else blocks
- B904: Use `raise ... from` in exception handlers
- PTH123: Use `Path.open()` instead of `open()`
- TRY401: Redundant exception in logger.exception calls
- PLC0415: Import should be at top-level

These are code style improvements that don't affect functionality and can be addressed in a separate cleanup PR if desired.
