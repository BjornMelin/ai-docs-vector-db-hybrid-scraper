# Load and Performance Testing Suite

This directory contains comprehensive load and performance testing for system capacity and scalability validation.

## Directory Structure

- **load_testing/**: Normal load condition testing
- **stress_testing/**: Beyond-capacity stress testing
- **spike_testing/**: Sudden load increase testing
- **endurance_testing/**: Long-duration performance testing
- **volume_testing/**: Large dataset volume testing
- **scalability/**: System scalability and growth testing

## Running Load Tests

```bash
# Run all load tests
uv run pytest tests/load/ -v

# Run specific load category
uv run pytest tests/load/stress_testing/ -v

# Run with load markers
uv run pytest -m load -v
```

## Test Categories

### Load Testing (load_testing/)
- Normal user load simulation
- Expected traffic pattern testing
- System performance under normal conditions
- Response time validation

### Stress Testing (stress_testing/)
- Beyond-capacity load testing
- Breaking point identification
- System behavior under extreme load
- Recovery after stress testing

### Spike Testing (spike_testing/)
- Sudden traffic spike simulation
- Auto-scaling validation
- Performance during traffic spikes
- System stability under sudden load

### Endurance Testing (endurance_testing/)
- Long-duration load testing
- Memory leak detection
- Performance degradation over time
- System stability over extended periods

### Volume Testing (volume_testing/)
- Large dataset processing
- Database performance with large volumes
- Memory usage with large data sets
- Storage performance validation

### Scalability Testing (scalability/)
- Horizontal scaling validation
- Vertical scaling testing
- Auto-scaling functionality
- Performance scaling patterns
