"""Multi-agent coordination and result fusion test suite.

This module contains comprehensive integration tests for multi-agent systems,
focusing on coordination patterns, result fusion algorithms, distributed
workflows, and state synchronization capabilities that enable 3-10x performance
improvements for complex RAG operations.

Test Categories:
- Coordination Patterns: Hierarchical and parallel coordination between agents
- Result Fusion: Advanced algorithms for aggregating multi-agent results
- Distributed Workflows: Complex workflow execution with agent handoffs
- State Synchronization: Cross-agent state management and conflict resolution

Based on J4 research findings for autonomous agent coordination and performance optimization.
