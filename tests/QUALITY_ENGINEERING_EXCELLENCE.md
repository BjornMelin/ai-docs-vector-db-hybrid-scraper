from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from hypothesis.stateful import RuleBasedStateMachine

class DocumentProcessingMachine(RuleBasedStateMachine):
    """Stateful testing for document processing workflows."""
    
    @rule(content=st.text(min_size=1))
    def add_document(self, content):
        # Test document addition with various content types
        pass
    
    @rule()
    def search_documents(self):
        # Test search consistency across all states
        pass
```

### 2. Contract-First Development

```python
# Pact consumer-driven contracts
from pact import Consumer, Provider

pact = Consumer('vector-db-client').has_pact_with(Provider('vector-db-api'))

@pact.given('documents exist in collection')
@pact.upon_receiving('search request')
def test_search_contract():
    # Contract defines expected behavior
    pass
```

### 3. Chaos Engineering Integration

```python
# Automated chaos scenarios
import chaos_toolkit

def test_service_resilience_under_network_partition():
    """Test system behavior during network failures."""
    with chaos_toolkit.network_partition(['service-a', 'service-b']):
        # Validate graceful degradation
        pass
```

### 4. Performance Contract Testing

```python
# Performance SLA validation
import pytest
import time

@pytest.mark.performance
def test_search_performance_contract():
    """Validate search performance meets SLA."""
    start_time = time.time()
    result = search_service.search("test query")
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert duration < 0.1  # 100ms SLA
    assert len(result) > 0  # Quality requirement
```

        super().__init__()
        self.collections = set()
        self.documents = {}
    
    @rule(collection_name=st.text(min_size=1, max_size=50))
    def create_collection(self, collection_name):
        # Test collection creation invariants
        pass
```

### 2. Metamorphic Testing
```python
# Testing properties that should hold across transformations
def test_search_commutativity():
    """Search results should be consistent regardless of query order."""
    query_a = "machine learning"
    query_b = "ML algorithms"
    
    # Metamorphic property: related queries should have overlap
    results_a = search_service.search(query_a)
    results_b = search_service.search(query_b)
    
    # Property: semantic similarity should show some overlap
    assert len(set(results_a) & set(results_b)) > 0
```

### 3. Generative Testing
```python
# AI-powered test case generation
from hypothesis import strategies as st

@st.composite
def generate_document_workflow(draw):
    """Generate realistic document processing workflows."""
    operations = draw(st.lists(
        st.sampled_from(['add', 'update', 'delete', 'search']),
        min_size=1, max_size=10
    ))
    return DocumentWorkflow(operations)
