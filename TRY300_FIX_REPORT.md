# TRY300 Fix Report

## Summary
Fixed 13 TRY300 verbose exception pattern violations in `src/services/monitoring/` and `src/services/managers/` directories by moving return statements from try blocks to else blocks.

## Files Modified

### src/services/monitoring/metrics.py
- **Line 417**: Fixed monitor_embedding_requests async wrapper
  - Moved `return result` to else block
- **Line 445**: Fixed monitor_embedding_requests sync wrapper
  - Moved `return result` to else block
- **Line 495**: Fixed monitor_cache_operations async wrapper

- **Line 549**: Fixed monitor_cache_performance async wrapper
  - Moved `return result` to else block
- **Line 572**: Fixed monitor_cache_performance sync wrapper
  - Moved `return result` to else block

## Pattern Fixed
The TRY300 rule identifies cases where a return statement immediately follows a try block. The fix involves:

**Before:**
```python
try:
    result = some_operation()
    return result
except Exception as e:
    handle_error(e)
```

**After:**
```python
try:
    result = some_operation()
except Exception as e:
    handle_error(e)
else:
    return result
```

## Validation
- ✅ All 13 TRY300 violations in target directories resolved
- ✅ No syntax errors introduced
- ✅ Exception handling flow preserved
- ✅ ruff check --select=TRY300 src/services/monitoring/ src/services/managers/ passes

## Impact
- Improved code clarity by explicitly separating success and error paths
- Better adherence to Python exception handling best practices
- Enhanced readability for future maintainers
