# Planning Archive

This directory now acts as the lightweight index for programme-level planning artefacts. All
technical research, migration write-ups, and operating guides have been consolidated under the
`docs/` tree.

## Current Contents

- `COMPREHENSIVE_SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md` – final synthesis of the multi-phase research effort.
- `MAIN_TRACKING_RESEARCH_REPORT.md` – historical tracker for workstreams and timelines.
- `master_report.md` – master roll-up; references the consolidated documentation for each phase.
- `status.json` – structured snapshot used by the planning dashboards.
- `docs/project-context.md` – contextual notes that remain relevant to programme history.
- `templates/` – reusable planning templates.

## Research Relocation

All documents that previously lived under `planning/done/` have been merged into the main
documentation set. Use `docs/plans/research-consolidation-map.md` to find the new location of any
legacy report.

If additional planning material needs to be promoted to the primary documentation, follow the same
pattern: migrate content into the appropriate file under `docs/`, then record the mapping inside the
consolidation map for future reference.
