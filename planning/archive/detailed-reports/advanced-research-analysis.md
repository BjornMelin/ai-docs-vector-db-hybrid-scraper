```python
# Multi-Agent Workflow Example
class AgentWorkflow:
    async def process_complex_query(self, query: str) -> AgenticRAGResult:
        # 1. Query Understanding Agent
        query_plan = await self.query_agent.run(query)
        
        # 2. Parallel Search Coordination
        search_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            self.search_agent.run(strategy) for strategy in query_plan.strategies
        ])
        
        # 3. Result Synthesis with Quality Assurance
        return await self.synthesis_agent.run(query, search_results)
```

- **Predictive Maintenance**: ML-based threshold optimization

**Key Automation Components:**
```python
class ZeroMaintenanceConfig:
    def auto_detect_environment(self) -> Environment:
        # Automatic environment detection and configuration
        return detected_environment
    
    def adapt_to_resources(self) -> Config:
        # Resource-based configuration optimization
        return optimized_config

**Priority Changes:**
```python
# Phase 1: Immediate Wins (Low Risk)
"slowapi>=0.1.9,<0.2.0"                   # Basic rate limiting
"purgatory-circuitbreaker>=1.0.3,<2.0.0"  # Distributed circuit breaker
"cachetools>=5.3.0,<6.0.0"                # Enhanced async caching
```

**Expected Impact:**
