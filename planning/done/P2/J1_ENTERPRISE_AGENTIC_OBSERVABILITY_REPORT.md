    def visualize_workflow(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate workflow visualization data."""
        return {
            "nodes": [node.to_dict() for node in self.interaction_graph],

## Enterprise Integration Architecture

### OpenTelemetry Integration Enhancement

Our existing OpenTelemetry infrastructure requires enhancement for agentic systems:

**AI-Specific Semantic Conventions:**
```python
class AgenticTelemetryAttributes:
    # Agent identification
    AGENT_ID = "ai.agent.id"
    AGENT_TYPE = "ai.agent.type"
    AGENT_VERSION = "ai.agent.version"
    
    # Decision tracking
    DECISION_TYPE = "ai.decision.type"
    DECISION_CONFIDENCE = "ai.decision.confidence"
    DECISION_QUALITY = "ai.decision.quality"
    
    # Multi-agent workflow
    WORKFLOW_ID = "ai.workflow.id"
    AGENT_COORDINATION = "ai.coordination.type"
    WORKFLOW_COMPLEXITY = "ai.workflow.complexity"
    
    # Learning metrics
    LEARNING_RATE = "ai.learning.rate"
    ADAPTATION_SCORE = "ai.adaptation.score"
    STRATEGY_EFFECTIVENESS = "ai.strategy.effectiveness"
```

        self.tracer = tracer
    
    def create_agent_decision_span(
        self, 
        agent_id: str, 
        decision_type: str,
        context: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Span:
        """Create span for agent decision tracking."""
        span = self.tracer.start_span(f"agent.decision.{decision_type}")
        span.set_attributes({
            AgenticTelemetryAttributes.AGENT_ID: agent_id,
            AgenticTelemetryAttributes.DECISION_TYPE: decision_type,
            AgenticTelemetryAttributes.DECISION_CONFIDENCE: context.get("confidence", 0.0)
        })
        return span
```

### Metrics Bridge for Existing Infrastructure

**Enhanced Metrics Collection:**
```python
class AgenticMetricsRegistry(MetricsRegistry):
    def __init__(self, config: MetricsConfig):
        super().__init__(config)
        self._setup_agentic_metrics()
    
    def _setup_agentic_metrics(self):
        """Setup agentic-specific metrics."""
        namespace = self.config.namespace
        
        # Agent decision metrics
        self._metrics["agent_decision_quality"] = Histogram(
            f"{namespace}_agent_decision_quality",
            "Quality score of agent decisions",
            ["agent_id", "decision_type"],
            buckets=(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0)
        )
        
        # Multi-agent workflow metrics
        self._metrics["workflow_coordination_overhead"] = Histogram(
            f"{namespace}_workflow_coordination_overhead_ms",
            "Coordination overhead in multi-agent workflows",
            ["workflow_type"],
            buckets=(10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000)
        )
        
        # Auto-RAG metrics

    def __init__(self):
        self.adaptive_thresholds = {}
        self.alert_history = []
        self.ml_predictor = FailurePredictionEngine()
    
    def evaluate_agent_health_alert(
        self, 
        agent_metrics: AgentHealthMetrics
    ) -> Optional[Alert]:
        """Evaluate agent health for alerting."""
        # Use ML to predict if intervention is needed
        health_score = agent_metrics.calculate_agent_health_score()
        
        # Adaptive threshold based on historical performance
        threshold = self._calculate_adaptive_threshold(
            agent_metrics.agent_id, 
            health_score
        )
        
        if health_score < threshold:
            return Alert(
                name=f"agent_degradation_{agent_metrics.agent_id}",
                description=f"Agent {agent_metrics.agent_id} showing performance degradation",
                severity=self._calculate_severity(health_score, threshold),
                recommended_actions=self._generate_remediation_plan(agent_metrics),
                auto_remediation_available=True
            )
        
        return None
```

    def __init__(self, observability_platform):
        self.platform = observability_platform
        self.remediation_engine = AutoRemediationEngine()
        
    async def handle_agent_incident(self, alert: Alert):
        """Handle agent-specific incidents."""
        incident_type = self._classify_incident(alert)
        
        # Attempt automated remediation
        if alert.auto_remediation_available:
            remediation_result = await self.remediation_engine.remediate(
                incident_type, 
                alert.context
            )
            
            if remediation_result.success:
                alert.resolve()
                self._log_successful_remediation(alert, remediation_result)
            else:
                self._escalate_to_human(alert, remediation_result)
        else:
            self._escalate_to_human(alert)
```

                    )
                    raise
                finally:

## Conclusion

The transition to agentic AI systems represents a fundamental shift in how we approach system observability. Traditional monitoring focused on system health and performance metrics is insufficient for autonomous systems that make independent decisions, learn from interactions, and coordinate complex workflows.

Our comprehensive observability strategy builds upon existing OpenTelemetry infrastructure while introducing specialized monitoring for:

1. **Autonomous Decision Quality** - Moving beyond performance to track decision-making effectiveness
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Visualizing and optimizing complex agent interactions
3. **Auto-RAG Performance** - Monitoring iterative improvement and learning effectiveness
4. **Self-Healing Systems** - Tracking autonomous remediation and predictive health management
5. **Enterprise Integration** - Seamlessly extending existing monitoring infrastructure

The proposed implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to building production-ready agentic observability while maintaining compatibility with existing systems and ensuring enterprise-grade security and performance.

By implementing these observability patterns, we transform from reactive monitoring to proactive, intelligent system health management that scales with the complexity and autonomy of modern agentic AI systems. This foundation will be essential as we continue to expand our autonomous capabilities and deploy increasingly sophisticated multi-agent workflows.

The investment in comprehensive agentic observability pays dividends through improved system reliability, faster incident resolution, better business outcomes, and increased confidence in autonomous system deployments. As agentic AI becomes central to business operations, this level of observability transitions from nice-to-have to mission-critical infrastructure.
