## V2 FEATURES

Additional advanced features have been moved to [TODO-V2.md](./TODO-V2.md) for implementation after the initial unified MCP server release.

### ‚úÖ **V2 Issues Status Update (2025-05-30)**

- **Issue #87**: ‚úÖ **CLOSED COMPLETE** - Advanced Query Processing (75-80% implemented, core functionality production-ready)
- **Issue #88**: üîÑ **REOPENED FOR V2** - Multi-Collection Search (V2 feature, reopened for future tracking)
- **Issue #89**: üîÑ **REOPENED FOR V2** - Comprehensive Analytics (partial foundation exists, advanced features for V2)
- **Issue #90**: üîÑ **REOPENED FOR V2** - Export/Import Tools (V2 feature, reopened for future tracking)
- **Issue #91**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Complete Advanced Query Processing for 100% feature completion

### üìã **V2 Features Include:**

- **Advanced Query Enhancement Completion** (Issue #91) - Complete remaining query processing features for 100% implementation
- **Multi-Collection Search** (Issue #88) - Cross-collection federation and intelligent result merging
- **Comprehensive Analytics** (Issue #89) - Real-time dashboards, search quality monitoring, intelligent alerting
- **Export/Import Tools** (Issue #90) - Multi-format data portability, automated backup, cross-platform migration
- Context-Aware Chunking strategies
- Incremental Updates with smart detection
- Enterprise-grade features and scalability

The current TODO focuses on essential features for a solid V1 release with direct API/SDK integration.
