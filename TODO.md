## V2 FEATURES

Additional advanced features have been moved to [TODO-V2.md](./TODO-V2.md) for implementation after the initial unified MCP server release. These include:

- Advanced Query Enhancement & HyDE
- Multi-Collection Search
- Comprehensive Usage Analytics
- Export/Import Tools
- Context-Aware Chunking
- Incremental Updates
- And more...

The current TODO focuses on essential features for a solid V1 release with direct API/SDK integration.
