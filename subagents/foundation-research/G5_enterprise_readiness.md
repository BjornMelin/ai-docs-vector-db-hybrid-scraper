class EnterpriseAgent:
    """Pydantic-AI agent with enterprise observability."""
    
    def __init__(self, model: str, system_prompt: str):
        self.agent = Agent(model=model, system_prompt=system_prompt)
        self.performance_tracker = PerformanceTracker()
        self.security_monitor = SecurityMonitor()
    
    @track_agent_performance
    @monitor_agent_security
    async def run(self, query: str) -> Any:
        """Enterprise-wrapped agent execution."""
        with self.performance_tracker.track_request():

class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent = Agent(...)  # Pydantic-AI core
        # Leverage existing enterprise infrastructure
```

### 2. Observability: Keep OpenTelemetry Stack

## Conclusion

**The enterprise readiness assessment concludes that our existing OpenTelemetry-based infrastructure already exceeds industry standards for enterprise observability, monitoring, and security.**

**Pydantic-AI should be integrated as a component within this proven architecture rather than replacing it.** This approach:

- **Avoids over-engineering** by preserving working enterprise infrastructure
- **Maintains simplicity** by requiring minimal integration code (< 100 lines)
- **Ensures 99.9% uptime** through proven monitoring and health check systems
- **Preserves flexibility** by avoiding vendor lock-in with Logfire
- **Reduces risk** by keeping production-tested observability stack

The "native Pydantic-AI approach" for enterprise needs would actually increase complexity and risk compared to our hybrid integration strategy. Our recommendation aligns perfectly with the goals of avoiding over-engineering while maintaining enterprise production readiness.

**Final Verdict: PROCEED with hybrid Pydantic-AI integration within existing enterprise infrastructure - optimal balance of simplicity, capability, and production readiness.**
