## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Critical Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Browser-Use Compatibility Issue 🎯
**Problem:** browser-use 0.2.6 locked psutil to 6.0.0, incompatible with Python 3.13
```toml
# Before: psutil==6.0.0 (locked by browser-use)
# After: psutil>=7.0.0,<8.0.0 (Python 3.13 compatible)
```
**Solution:** Updated psutil to Python 3.13 compatible version, providing browser automation through Playwright instead

#### 2. AI/ML Stack Modernization 🤖
```toml
# Modern AI/ML dependencies
"openai>=1.56.0,<2.0.0",           # Latest API features
"FlagEmbedding>=1.3.5,<2.0.0",     # Performance improvements  
"fastembed>=0.7.0,<0.8.0",         # Native Python 3.13 support
"crawl4ai[all]>=0.6.3,<0.8.0",     # Major version upgrade
```

#### 3. Data Processing Optimization 📈
```toml
# Enhanced data processing stack
"pandas>=2.2.3,<3.0.0",            # Performance optimized
"numpy>=1.26.0,<3.0.0",            # NumPy 2.x support
"scipy>=1.15.3,<2.0.0",            # Python 3.13 ready
```

### Configuration Modernization

#### Python Version Support
```toml
requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.14"   # Full 3.11-3.13 support
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12", 
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13",  # Added
]
```

#### Development Tools
```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py313"            # Updated for Python 3.13

[tool.mypy] 
python_version = "3.13"             # Type checking target

[tool.uv]
compile-bytecode = true             # Performance optimization
resolution = "highest"              # Latest compatible versions
```
