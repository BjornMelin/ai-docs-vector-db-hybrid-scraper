### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1: Infrastructure Modernization + Core Agentic Foundation** (Weeks 1-4)
  - H1-H5 infrastructure modernization implementation
  - Pydantic-AI native migration with BaseAgent framework
- **Phase 2: Autonomous Data & Search Systems** (Weeks 5-12)
  - I3-I5 advanced data acquisition capabilities
- **Phase 3: Multi-Agent Coordination & Observability** (Weeks 13-20)
  - J1-J4 enterprise agentic capabilities

## Archive Directory

The `archive/` directory contains:
- **`legacy-phases/`** - Previous research phases (P0-P3, I1-I2) 
- **`deprecated-tool-composition-research/`** - Tool composition research (superseded by Pydantic-AI native)
- **`detailed-reports/`** - Historical detailed analysis reports

**Note:** H1-H5 documents have been moved from archive to active `infrastructure-research/` subdirectory as they contain current infrastructure modernization requirements complementary to agentic capabilities.

## Research Confidence Levels

All core research documents achieve **95-98% confidence validation** with comprehensive implementation plans, quantified benefits, and production-ready architectural recommendations.

## Next Steps
