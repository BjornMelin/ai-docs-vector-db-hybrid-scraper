## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Auto-Detection and Adaptation
```python
# Environment-aware configuration
environment = detect_environment()  # kubernetes, docker, aws, ci, development
database_url = auto_detect_database()  # environment-specific connection
worker_count = os.cpu_count()  # resource-based scaling
scale_threshold = adaptive_threshold()  # performance-based thresholds
```

### 2. Self-Healing Circuit Breakers
```python
# Adaptive failure handling
circuit_breaker = AdaptiveCircuitBreaker("service_name")
result = await circuit_breaker.call(service_function, *args)
# Automatically adapts thresholds based on historical performance
```

### 3. Configuration Drift Auto-Correction
```python
# Continuous configuration monitoring
drift_healer = ConfigDriftHealer(config_manager)
await drift_healer.start_monitoring()  # Detects and fixes drift automatically
```

### 4. Intelligent Resource Scaling
```python
# Automatic resource optimization
scaling_manager = AutoScalingManager()
await scaling_manager.start_monitoring()  # Scales based on real-time metrics
```

## Integration Points

### FastAPI Application Integration
```python
from src.automation import (
    get_auto_config,
    get_self_healing_manager,
    start_config_automation
)

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    # Initialize zero-maintenance systems
    config = await get_auto_config()
    healing_manager = await get_self_healing_manager()
    await healing_manager.initialize(config.database_url)
    await start_config_automation()
```

### Database Integration
```python
# Self-healing database sessions
@asynccontextmanager
async def get_db_session():
    healing_manager = await get_self_healing_manager()
    async with healing_manager.database_manager.get_session() as session:
        yield session  # Automatically recovers from connection failures
```

### Service Integration
```python
# Circuit breaker protected service calls
async def call_external_service():
    healing_manager = await get_self_healing_manager()
    breaker = healing_manager.get_circuit_breaker("external_api")
    return await breaker.call(api_client.make_request)
```

## Monitoring and Observability
