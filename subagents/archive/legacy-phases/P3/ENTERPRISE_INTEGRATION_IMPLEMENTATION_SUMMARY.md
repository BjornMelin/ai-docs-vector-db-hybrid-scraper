## Integration Patterns Implemented

### 1. Service Discovery and Registration
```python
# Register enterprise service with dependencies
await service_registry.register_service(
    service=enterprise_cache_service,
    dependencies=["redis_service", "monitoring_service"],
    config=cache_config,
    criticality="high"
)
```

### 2. Configuration Management
```python
# Load unified enterprise configuration
config = await load_enterprise_configuration()

# Watch for configuration changes
await start_configuration_watching()

# Add change handler for specific config sections
orchestrator.add_change_handler("cache", handle_cache_config_change)
```

### 3. Observability Integration
```python
# Record performance metrics
platform.record_metric(
    name="response_time_ms",
    value=125.0,
    metric_type=MetricType.TIMER,
    tags={"endpoint": "/search"},
    service_name="enterprise_search"
)

# Start distributed trace
span = platform.start_trace("search_request", "enterprise_search")
span.log_event("info", "Starting hybrid search")
platform.finish_span(span, TraceStatus.SUCCESS)
```

### 4. Health Monitoring
```python
# Check service health
health_status = await service_registry.validate_service_health("enterprise_search")

# Get system-wide status
system_status = await service_registry.get_system_status()

# Monitor overall health
health_report = platform.get_system_health()
```
