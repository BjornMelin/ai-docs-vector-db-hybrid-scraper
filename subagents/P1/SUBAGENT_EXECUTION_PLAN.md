## 🚀 Subagent Group Deployment Strategy

### **Group A: Core Architecture Foundation (Week 1 - Parallel Execution)**
*Independent tasks - launch all 3 subagents simultaneously*

#### **A1. Dependency Injection Implementation Subagent**
**Mission**: Eliminate circular dependencies and establish clean service boundaries

**Objectives**:
- Create dependency injection container using `dependency-injector`
- Extract 5 core clients from ClientManager (OpenAI, Qdrant, Redis, HTTP, Firecrawl)
- Remove circular imports in config layer
- Update import paths across affected modules

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Circular dependencies: 12+ → 0 cycles
- [ ] Import complexity: 90% reduction  
- [ ] All tests passing after refactoring
- [ ] Clean service boundaries established

**Key Deliverables**:
```python
# New dependency injection container
class ApplicationContainer(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    config = providers.Singleton(Config)
    openai_client = providers.Singleton(AsyncOpenAI, api_key=config.provided.openai.api_key)
    qdrant_client = providers.Singleton(AsyncQdrantClient, url=config.provided.qdrant.url)
    # ... other core clients
```

**Implementation Focus**:
- `src/infrastructure/container.py` - DI container implementation

- Implement clean service interfaces with single responsibility
- Update dependency injection container for new service architecture

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] ClientManager: 1,370 → 300 lines
- [ ] Service coupling: High → Low

    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        embedding_tasks = [tg.create_task(generate_embedding(doc)) for doc in docs]
        classification_tasks = [tg.create_task(classify_content(doc)) for doc in docs]
    
    embeddings = [task.result() for task in embedding_tasks]
    classifications = [task.result() for task in classification_tasks]
    return combine_results(embeddings, classifications)
